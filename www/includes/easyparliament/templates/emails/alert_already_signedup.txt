Subject: Already signed up for an alert on TheyWorkForYou,com
Someone, maybe you, tried to sign you up for an alert on
TheyWorkForYou.com that you are already signed up for with
the following criteria:

{CRITERIA}

As you are already signed up for this we've not signed you up
to it again.

If you have not tried to register for this alert then someone else
entered your address. If you think this has been done maliciously
then let us know.

Best wishes,
TheyWorkForYou
