Subject: Your payment for the TheyWorkForYou API has failed
Hi,

I'm afraid that when we tried to take payment for your subscription to the
TheyWorkForYou API, it failed. It is possible that this is due to your bank
requiring extra confirmation of the payment, in which case you will also
receive an email from our payment processor containing a link to provide
that extra confirmation.

Otherwise, we'll try again in three days time, but please could you log in
to TheyWorkForYou and check that your payment details are up to date:
    https://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/key

In the meantime, your quota has not been reset.

Please get in touch if you have any questions:

Yours,
mySociety
