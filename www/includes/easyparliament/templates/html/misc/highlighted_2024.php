                <a name="intro"></a>
                <p>As part of our 2024/25 WhoFundsThem project, we are highlighting declared interests that we feel merit being more visible, based on known public attitudes towards certain industries.</p>
                <p>You can read more about our research and choices in the accompanying <a href="http://research.mysociety.org/html/beyond-transparency/">Beyond Transparency report</a> </p>

                <p>Nothing in this section was against the rules for MPs to accept and they have been correctly declared.</p>
                <p>MPs have been given a chance to add comments, to add context around the donations. </p>

                <p>Our volunteers have been highlighting industries and individuals that have links to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A countryâ€™s government that is scored 'Not Free' by Freedom House</li>
                    <li>Oil and gas industry</li>
                    <li>Gambling industry</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is not an exhaustive list of industries, and we have excluded rather than included borderline cases. </p>
