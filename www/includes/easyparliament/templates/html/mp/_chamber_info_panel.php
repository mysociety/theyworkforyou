    Your MP (<?= ucfirst($full_name) ?>) represents you, and all of the people who live in <?= $latest_membership['constituency'] ?>,
        at the UK Parliament in Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
    MPs split their time between Parliament and their constituency.
        In Parliament, they debate and vote on new laws, review existing laws, and question the Government.
        In the constituency, their focus is on supporting local people and championing local issues.
        They have a small staff team who help with casework, maintain their diaries, and monitor their inbox.
