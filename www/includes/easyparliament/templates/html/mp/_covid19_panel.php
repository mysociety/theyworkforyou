    <h2>There are currently votes on relevant topics that are not included in the summaries below. We are working on bringing these records up to date over the next few months. </h2>
    <h2>As a result of COVID-19, some MPs were less able to vote in Parliament in certain periods, and this will be reflected by absences in their voting record.</h2>

                <p>All MPs could vote remotely through an online voting tool. Votes cast remotely are shown as normal on the TheyWorkForYou voting record.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>2nd to 9th June 2020</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The option of online voting was removed, and a number of MPs may have been unable to vote because they were not physically able to attend.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>10th June 2020 onwards</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The requirements on proxy voting were relaxed, allowing MPs to designate another MP to cast a vote on their behalf.</p>
                <p>If an MP votes by proxy, it is effectively exactly the same as if they cast the vote in person and it shows up on their TheyWorkForYou voting record.</p>
                <p>MPs are not required to designate a proxy, and may instead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_(parliamentary_convention)">pair with an opposing MP</a> to miss a vote. Parliament does not record when two MPs have come to a pairing arrangement, so on TheyWorkForYou, they will both appear to have been absent for the vote.</p>

        <p>We will update this information if the situation changes. <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2020/07/06/parliamentary-votes-during-covid-19/">See more detail on votes during the COVID-19 period here.</a></p>
