                The current <b>Northern Ireland Assembly</b> was established in 1998 as part of the
                Belfast Agreement.
                </p>

                <p>
                As of 2023, the assembly has sitting MLAs,
                <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/ni/?id=2023-02-14.1.2#g1.25"> has been unable to reach the cross-community agreement required to elect a speaker</a>.
                
                As such, there will be no debates in the Assembly until a speaker is elected.
