                Previously called Standing Committees, Public Bill Commitees
                study proposed legislation (Bills) in detail, debating each
                clause and reporting any amendments to the Commons for further debate.
                </p>

                <p>
                There are at least 16 MPs on a Committee, and the proportion
                of parties reflects the House of Commons, so the government
                always has a majority.
