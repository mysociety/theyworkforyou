            <h1>House Rules</h1>
<p>As a registered user, you may add annotations to debate pages on TheyWorkForYou &mdash; now that&rsquo;s power.</p>

<p>But as we all know, with great power comes great responsibility. In order to keep TheyWorkForYou useful and relevant to everyone, there are a few rules. They are important.</p>

<p>Stick to these and you can&rsquo;t go wrong. Transgress once, and we&rsquo;ll send you a warning. Do it again and you&rsquo;re banned, and that&rsquo;s as fair as we can make it.</p>

            <h2>Annotations should be</h2>

            <ul><li><b>Relevant to the debate you are commenting on</b>: that&rsquo;s <em>completely</em> relevant.</li>
                <li><b>Factual</b>: Check your sources. Citing them is good.</li>
                <li><b>Non-partisan</b>, ie not showing a political bias</li>
                <li><b>Under your own name</b> where possible</li>
                <li><b>Genuinely useful for other readers</b>: and if you can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to this one, that&rsquo;s a pretty good sign that your comment shouldn&rsquo;t be added.</li></ul>

            <h2>You might like to</h2>

            <ul><li><b>Provide a link to a webpage</b> &mdash; but that page must also be relevant, factual, useful, and non-partisan.   </li></ul>

            <h2>Things to avoid</h2>

            <ul><li><b>Don't go off-topic</b>. You&rsquo;re commenting on the debate, nothing else.</li>
                <li><b>We don't want your opinions or anecdotes</b>. There are plenty of other forums for those: try your local newspaper, for example.</li>
                <li><b>Avoid bad or upsetting language</b>. All types of people use TheyWorkForYou. Don&rsquo;t write anything you wouldn&rsquo;t want your own grandmother or child to read &mdash; because they (or someone just like them) might.</li>
                <li><b>We don't tolerate attacks on other users</b>. We are kind to one another here.</li>
                <li><b>Same goes for attacks or disparagement of any section of society</b>. See above.</li>
                <li><b>Don't spam our readers</b>: and we count anything that could be described as an advertisement as spam. Because it is.</li></ul>

            <h2>If you see an annotation which does not adhere to these rules</h2>

            <p>
            <b>You can report it</b>. You&rsquo;ll see a small link marked &lsquo;<em>report this annotation</em>&rsquo; at the top of the comment, near the timestamp.

            We&rsquo;ll take a look at the annotation and take any necessary steps.
