            <h1>TheyWorkForYou makes Parliament easier to understand</h1>

            <p>Most people don&rsquo;t know the name of their MP, let alone
            what they&rsquo;ve been saying in Parliament, or how they&rsquo;ve
            voted.</p>

            <p>TheyWorkForYou aims to get that changed.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Why bother? It&rsquo;s just a load of boring old politicians</h2>

            <p>We know that Parliament can be dry, fusty, and even
            intimidating. And there&rsquo;s the problem: keeping up just
            involves too much effort.</p>

            <p>Once you get past those barriers, though, you&rsquo;ll find
            information that can entertain you, educate you and&mdash;no
            exaggeration&mdash;give you the power to get things changed.
            We think that should be available to everyone.</p>

            <h2>That&rsquo;s where TheyWorkForYou comes in</h2>

            <p>TheyWorkForYou launched in 2004, taking data and information
            from official parliamentary sources and adding features that make
            them easier to understand, like:</p>

            <ul class="about-page__features">
                <li>A search box, so you can find mentions of any topic, in debates as recent as yesterday or as far back as the 1930s.</li>
                <li>Not just the name, but the party, photo and position of each person who speaks, right next to their contribution to any debate.</li>
                <li>A unique link for every statement, so you can share precisely what someone said, by email, Twitter or Facebook.</li>
                <li>An alert sign-up, so you don&rsquo;t have to come to the site to see what your MP is saying: it&rsquo;ll drop straight into your email inbox instead.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And that&rsquo;s, basically, what we&rsquo;re all about: making it so easy to follow Parliament, that you, and everyone else, will know exactly what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
