            <p>It&rsquo;d be fantastic if TheyWorkForYou also covered the
            Senedd, as we do with the
            <a href="/ni/">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> and the
            <a href="/scotland/">Scottish Parliament</a>.

            <p>But we don&rsquo;t currently have the time or resources
            to add the Senedd ourselves. In fact, because the
            code that runs TheyWorkForYou is
            <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/theyworkforyou">open
            source</a>, both Scotland and Northern Ireland were mainly
            added by volunteers.</p>

            <h2>Next steps</h2>

            <p>If you can help us add the Senedd to TheyWorkForYou,
            <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mysociety.org/forum/#!forum/theyworkforyou">join
            our discussion list</a> and say hello.</p>

            <p>If not, maybe you can get the information you need on <a href="https://senedd.wales/">the official Senedd website</a>.</p>
