<p>For all its faults and foibles, our democracy is a profound gift from previous generations.
Yet most people don't know the name of their MP, nor their constituency, let alone what their
MP does or says in their name.</p>

<p>We aim to help bridge this growing democratic disconnect, in the belief that there is
little wrong with Parliament that a healthy mixture of transparency and public engagement won't fix.</p>

<p>Hence this website.</p>

<h2>Who runs this site?</h2>

<p>TheyWorkForYou is a website run by <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>,
which is itself a project of UK Citizens Online Democracy, a registered charity.
It was originally built almost entirely by volunteers (see <a href="#history">History</a> below),
but now mySociety pays Matthew to keep the site running and up-to-date as part of his
wider work for mySociety. However, things are still added voluntarily by anyone who wishes. If you want to volunteer to help then you can, just <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/helpus/volunteering-for-theyworkforyou/">take a look at the Volunteering page</a>.

<h2><a name="history"></a>History</h2>

<p>TheyWorkForYou was set up almost entirely <a href="#1">[1]</a> by a dozen or so volunteers
who thought it should be really easy for people to keep tabs on their elected MPs,
and their unelected Peers, and comment on what goes on in Parliament. They'd done this
sort of thing before, but never on this scale.</p>

<p>(<a name="1">[1]</a> One of the key developers was kept fed for a month by a small grant
from UK Citizen's Online Democracy, before TheyWorkForYou became a mySociety project. This
money was vital. Hungry developers don't write good code. If you like
TheyWorkForYou, and want to support mySociety, you can <a
href="https://secure.mysociety.org/donate/">make a donation</a> yourself.)</p>

<p>Between them, the original volunteers had developed and run a range of not-for-profit websites of a vaguely similar ilk.
<a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/">PublicWhip.org.uk</a>,
<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/">PepysDiary.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.haddock.org/">Haddock.org</a>,
<a href="http://www.byliner.com/">Byliner.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.b3ta.com/">B3Ta</a>,
<a href="http://www.downingstreetsays.com/">DowningStreetSays.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">MySociety</a>,  and an accessible re-versioning of the
<a href="http://www.traintimes.org.uk/">National Rail Timetable</a> website.
They conceived and developed the original <a href="http://www.upmystreet.com/">UpMyStreet.com</a>
back in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981202165125/http://www.upmystreet.com/">1998</a>.
</p>

<p>In early 2006 Tom and Stef decided that the overlap of people and goals with mySociety
was so substantial that it was best to pass the running over to mySociety, who are an actual
proper organisation with staff and time.</p>

<p>Matthew added the Northern Ireland Assembly as an early Christmas present in 2006, working
alone and voluntarily, perhaps as a nudge to the Scots and the Welsh to come forward and
work on their own versions. :)</p>

<p>This approach met with success as ace volunteer <a href="http://longair.net/mark/">Mark
Longair</a> contributed the parsing code and much front-end code for the Scottish Parliament
which launched in May 2008. Wales is now all alone&hellip;</p>

<h2>Volunteers</h2>

<p><em>They did all this in their spare time, because they thought it was worth doing.
And if it's worth doing, you might as well try to do it well. </em></p>

<p>Since the site launched, a variety of people have contributed to the running
of the site, both paid and voluntarily. Mark Longair added the Scottish
Parliament, and Matthew Somerville added the Northern Ireland Assembly. Etienne
Pollard did much of the work to get BBC Parliament video downloaded and
chunked. Richard Pope made the current design, and Joe Lanman contributed the
red Parliament logo. Deborah Kerr uploads photos of 19th century MPs as people
send them in, along with other user support. Louise Crow, Francis Irving,
Duncan Parkes, and others have fixed bugs, get the parser running, and so
on.</p>
