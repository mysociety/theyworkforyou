<dd>
<p>Here are some quotes from our users.</p>
<p>Jo Brodie, Science Information Officer &amp; Islet Project Coordinator, 
<a href="http://www.diabetes.org.uk">Diabetes UK</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"TheyWorkForYou.com contributes to my 'current awareness' of what is being said
about diabetes and insulin (access to treatment, statistics etc) and other
related health topics (for example organ transplantation and stem cell research
as that's very relevant for diabetes and its complications too). The email
alerts and RSS feeds mean the information lands rather helpfully in my intray.
</p>

<p>"The Science Information Team at Diabetes UK occasionally gets asked stats
questions on the numbers of people with diabetes, or a particular complication
of diabetes, in a specific location. We don't have access to this sort of data
but the top statisticians in the Department of Health do, so it's often worth
our while having a quick search to see if something's been asked and answered.
</p>

<p>"Even if a question results in "information of that nature is not held
centrally", that's useful because we can demonstrate that there isn't a good
answer and this will save the original enquirer spending time on a fruitless
search.
</p>

<p>"If information is forthcoming there is often a reference or info about the way
in which the evidence was collected - if this is publicly available then we can
use that resource to find other things. (I think this is how I found out about
the Prescription Pricing Authority which deals with costs of medications - a
useful resource when someone wants to know the impossible 'how many people use
insulin?'). So basically it 'begets' further info!
</p>

<p>"It's a great site - thank you."
</p>

<blockquote>"Use the site all the time and print off bits to send to
constituents.  My local newspapers are registered so they often
cover my comments in Parliament that I wouldn't even send out as a
press release."</blockquote>

</dd>

<dt><a name="missing"></a>Is this the whole of Hansard?</dt>
<dd>
<p>TheyWorkForYou currently contains:</p>
<ul><li>all debates, written answers, and written ministerial statements in the
House of Commons Hansard back to the General Election of June 2001;
<li>the same for the House of Lords Hansard (so as yet no
Grand Committees) back to around November 1999;
<li>everything in the various Northern Ireland (Transitional) Assembly debates. 
<li>everything in the Scottish Parliament official report. (check with Mark!)
</ul>

<p>But this is by no means everything. Think of what we've done thus far as a
mere taster of what could be possible.  In the future we plan to incorporate
the gems to be found in Parliamentary Committees, where many MPs and Peers do
good solid unheralded work improving legislation. If you want the complete,
definitive record, go to the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/" title="Link to
parliament website">UK Parliament</a> site, and you might be able to find what
you want.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="moderation"></a>How do you moderate comments?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ideally, we won't. If everyone keeps to the <a
href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/houserules/" title="link to House
Rules">House Rules</a>, that is. But we're not naive enough to think that life
online is that simple. TheyWorkForYou.com operates a 'reactive moderation'
policy. We will only check whether a comment breaches our House Rules if
someone lets us know of their concerns via the 'Report this Comment' link,
which can be found next to every comment. If we decide that the comment has
breached our House Rules, we will delete it and let the original author know
via email. We will also give them opportunity to rephrase and resubmit their
orginal comment. If we deem the comment to be legit, we'll leave it up, and
email the complainant to let them know why. We will do our utmost to respond to
reports of potential breaches of our House Rules within forty-eight hours, but
please bear in mind that this service is run by volunteers, and sometimes it
might take us slightly longer.</p> </dd>

<dt><a name="privacy"></a>What is your privacy policy?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Our privacy policy is very simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>We guarantee we will not sell or distribute any personal information you share with us
<li>We will not be sending you unsolicited email
<li>We will gladly show you the personal data we store about you in order to run the website.

<dt><a name="cookie"></a>What is your cookie policy?</dt>
<dd>
<p>We use cookies to save you from having to repeatedly log in to the site, and also to remember your postcode. The site will work with cookies disabled, but it won't be as good. </p>

<dt><a name="extreme"></a>What's that weird 'extreme tracker' and 'urchin' javascript I spy in your page source?</dt>
<dd>
<p>We use Extreme DB and Google Analytics to track aggregated traffic through the website. It captures nothing that you won't find in an Apache logfile, but has an interface we like, and is dead easy to use. Rest assured, we only track usage data for one reason only: to help us understand how we can make the site work better for you lot. If anyone wants to whinge about 'Web Bugs', expect short shrift. </p>

<dt><a name="rss"></a>What is RSS?</dt>
<dd>
<p>RSS files contain information about a list of things: diary entries, speeches, etc. and are formatted to be readable by computer programs, rather than humans. So what use are they? You can use a program called a news reader to store the locations of RSS feeds, and each time one is updated - with new diary entries or speeches - you can easily see what's new. It saves you visiting web pages on the off-chance anything new has appeared. Popular RSS readers are <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">Sharpreader</a> for Windows or <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/#lite">NetNewsWire Lite</a> for Macs. <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> is an online RSS reader.</p>

<dt><a name="votingrecord"></a>How is the voting record decided?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The voting record is not affected by what MPs and Peers have said, only how they
<strong>voted</strong> in relation to that topic in the house - i.e. "aye" or
"no".  Votes on each topic were examined, and strength of support determined
based on these votes.  Follow the "votes" link next to each topic for details.
Additionally, in many votes, MPs and Peers are told how to vote ('whipped') by their
parties. Since the Whip is secret, we have to assume, <a
href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2005-02-07.1200.2">like the
Speaker</a>, that all votes are free.  </P>

<p>If you put in some work, we will add new policies to the voting record
section. You need to research the policy, and make up a list of divisions in
Parliament relating to it and which way the votes go. You can then 
<a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/policies.php">enter these into the Public
Whip site</a>. When you're done, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> to get us
to add it to TheyWorkForYou. You must also be prepared to maintain this list of
votes as more related ones are cast in future.
</p>

<dt><a name="numbers"></a>Why should I read in more depth than just the numbers?</dt>

<dd>
<p>A few people have asked why we publish statistics on how often MPs use
alliterative phrases, such as "she sells seashells". It has even been <a
href="/debate/?id=2006-06-28a.348.0">mentioned in the House of Commons</a>.
</p>

<p>Simply put, we realise that data such as the number of debates spoken in
means little in terms of an MP's actual performance.  MPs do lots of useful
things which we don't count yet, and some which we never could.  Even when we
do, a count doesn't measure the quality of an MPs contribution.</p>

<p>After reading media reports like <a
href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-2060278,00.html">this one
in The Times</a>, and hearing from real MP's researchers who have admitted
to tabling questions to increase their boss's rankings, we became concerned about the
use of these statistics.</p>

<p>We've done two things. We've added the silly statistic, to catch your attention.
And we've removed the absolute rankings. Instead of saying an MP is exactly
5th for giving out verbiage in the chamber, we now just say that they are
"well above average". 

<p>Our advice &mdash; when you're judging your MP, read some of their speeches,
check out their website, even go to a local meeting and ask them a question.
Use TheyWorkForYou as a gateway, rather than a simple place to find a number
measuring competence.

<p>If you have suggestions for other metrics we could add which would be
useful, send them to the <a href="mailto:team&#64;theyworkforyou.com">usual
address</a>. We've got a few ideas ourselves, to keep you on your toes.

<dt><a name="pps_unknown"></a>Why are the PPS positions out of date?</dt>
<dd>
<p>TheyWorkForYou gets its ministerial information, as with much else, by
scraping various pages on the official parliament.uk site. Since the 16th of
January 2008, the <a
href="http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hciolists/Pps.cfm">page on
Parliamentary Private Secretaries</a>, that until that date listed them all,
simply says they do not maintain such a list. This means our scraper can no
longer find and work out the information, and so we do not know the current
PPSes.</p>

<p>This is obviously disappointing, but without a central list of Parliamentary
Private Secretaries, there doesn't appear to be a lot we can do. Apologies for
any inconvenience caused.</p>

<!--
<p>In order to fix this, we would either need to find a new source of information
and write a brand new parser solely for that &ndash; not a trivial task, and
one that leads to yet more maintenance every time the format changes &ndash; or
we need Parliament or the Government to provide us with a URL containing a
machine-readable file of all the PPSes that is kept up to date, which we can
then simply read and merge into our site every day (our preferred option!).

<dt><a name="api"></a>Do you have the data as a spreadsheet file, XML or in an API?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes. We have an <a href="/api">API (Application Programming Interface)</a> which 
gives you the power to do almost anything with our data.
Alternatively, you can <a href="http://ukparse.kforge.net/parlparse">get XML files</a>,
which can be loaded into many spreadsheets. If you just need a spreadsheet of
MPs, you'll find one on the right hand side of <a href="/mps">this page</a>. 
Please <a href="mailto:team&#64;theyworkforyou.com">mail us</a> if you want help 
working out how to use the data, or want to hire us to make something specific
for you.
