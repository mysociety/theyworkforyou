URL class v1.3 2003-11-25

REQUIRES:
	data.php v1.0
	utiltity.php v1.0
	GLOBALS:
		WEBPATH	/directory/



DOCUMENTATION:

The URL class is used for generating URLs and other related things.
Relies on there being a get_http_var() function.

This is probably how you'll use it most:

	$URL = new URL("yourpagename");
	print $URL->generate();

In the metadata you should set a session_vars variable, an array.
The default page session_vars may be just array("debug").
These can then be overridden on a per-page basis.
Session vars are GET/POST vars that will be passed by default to that page.
ie, if "foo=bar" is in the current URL and you generate a URL to a page that has "foo"
as a session_var, "foo=bar" will be automatically added to the generated URL.
You can modify the session vars that will be included in the URL generated using the functions below.


PUBLICALLY ACCESSIBLE FUNCTIONS:

restore() 	- Sets $URL->session_vars back to how they were when the object was instantiated.
reset() 	- Sets $URL->session_vars to be an empty array.
insert() 	- Add/overwrite session key and value pair(s).
remove() 	- Remove session key/value pair(s).
update() 	- Update the values of some/all session_vars.
generate() 	- Generate a URL to the page specified with session vars.
header_redirect_url()	- Generate a URL with
hidden_form_vars() - Prints hidden form variables.


VERSION HISTORY
v1.0	2003-07-16
v1.1	2003-09-10
			Changed format for $encode in generate().
			Insert() now overwrites existing variables, rather than maintaining them.
v1.2	2003-10-03
			Added support for "pg" variables in the metadata. You can create virtual
				pages from the same physical file.
v1.3	2003-11-25
			Changed from PAGEURL to URL. Now use defined constants instead of globals.
