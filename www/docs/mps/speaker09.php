<p>The <strong>new Speaker</strong> will be extremely important in making
Parliament more transparent, so that sites like this one can help people like
you understand more about <strong>what your MP is doing</strong>.</p>

<p>mySociety asked likely candidates for the post of Speaker to endorse the
following principles.</p>

<p><strong>The three principles are:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li> Voters have the right to know in <strong>detail about the money</strong>
that is spent to support MPs and run Parliament, and in similar detail how the
decisions to spend that money are settled upon. </li>

<li> Bills being considered must be published online in a much better way than
they are now, as the <strong>Free Our Bills</strong> campaign has been
suggesting for some time. </li>

<li> The Internet is not a threat to a renewal in our democracy, it is one of
its best hopes. Parliament should appoint a senior officer with direct working
experience of the <strong>power of the Internet</strong> who reports directly
to the Speaker, and who will help Parliament adapt to a new era of transparency
and effectiveness. </li>

</ol>
