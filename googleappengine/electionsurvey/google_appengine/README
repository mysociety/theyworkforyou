RUNNING THE SDK
=========================
You can run the SDK with the following command:

dev_appserver.py [options] <application root>

Application root must be the path to the application to run in this server.
Must contain a valid app.yaml or app.yml file.

Options:
  --help, -h                 View this helpful message.
  --debug, -d                Use debug logging. (Default false)
  --clear_datastore, -c      Clear the Datastore on startup. (Default false)
  --address=ADDRESS, -a ADDRESS
                             Address to which this server should bind. (Default
                             localhost).
  --port=PORT, -p PORT       Port for the server to run on. (Default 8080)
  --datastore_path=PATH      Path to use for storing Datastore file stub data.

USING THE SDK
=======================
For instructions on getting started with Google App Engine, please see the
Google App Engine Getting Started Guide

http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted


USING THE APP ENGINE LAUNCHER
=============================
The Windows and Mac OSX Python SDKs include an additional development tool
called the App Engine Launcher.  This tool provides a simple graphical
interface to create projects, run them locally, and deploy them to Google's App
Engine servers. It can be used in place of the dev_appserver and appcfg
command-line tools.

The Windows SDK can optionally install a desktop short-cut during
installation. If you are missing the short-cut, you can find the launcher in
the launcher subdirectory of your App Engine installation. The default
location is
C:\Program Files\Google\google_appengine\launcher\GoogleAppEngineLauncher.exe

In Mac OSX, the Launcher is installed by dragging it out of the .dmg to a
location specified by the user. The Launcher contains the SDK inside of it.
A typical drag-install destination for the Launcher and SDK is
/Applications/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app
