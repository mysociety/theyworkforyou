*S3M-4993 Cathy Jamieson: Proposed Closure of Girvan and Cumnock courts—That the Parliament notes the division in the Justice Committee on 5 May 2009, which recommended annulment of the Justice of the Peace Courts (Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway) Order 2009 (SSI 2009/115), which proposed to close courts in the Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway, including Girvan and Cumnock courts; deeply regrets the recent move to reinstigate closure proposals; believes that the principle of community justice is undermined by the centralisation of courts; notes the strong community support for the retention of these courts, and calls on the Justice Committee to reject again the misguided proposal by the Scottish Government to close courts in Girvan and Cumnock.
