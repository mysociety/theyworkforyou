 *S3M-5033 Bill Wilson: The Bravery of Corporal Scott Cox of the Royal Highland Fusiliers—That the Parliament congratulates Royal Highland Fusilier Corporal Scott Cox from Inverclyde who saved the lives of 16 US marines when their Armadillo jeep was disabled by Taliban rockets in Afghanistan by securing, under intense fire and at great personal risk, a tow rope to their vehicle and pulling it to safety; believes that his actions epitomise the bravery of many young men and women serving their country in Afghanistan and Iraq, in both of which Corporal Cox has served, and that, regardless of the rights and wrongs of the United Kingdom’s involvement in these countries, the courage and sacrifice of members of the armed forces should never be forgotten and that the risks that they face make it imperative for the UK Government to have, as a minimum, a coherent and workable strategy with clear objectives shaped with great regard for the value of all human lives and that such risks should never be incurred due to inadequate equipment.
