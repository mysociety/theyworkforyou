*S3M-4984# Bill Butler: Happy Birthday Citizens Advice Bureaux—That the Parliament congratulates the Citizens Advice service on its 70th anniversary; commends the vital work that Scotland’s 83 Citizens Advice Bureaux, 222 service points, staff and over 2,000 volunteers carry out in providing free, impartial and confidential advice to all; considers that such good quality advice on issues such as benefits, debt, employment, housing and consumer affairs is increasingly necessary in today’s society and that bureaux are often the first point of contact for people worried about these problems; recognises the need for bureaux in communities across the country, including Drumchapel where the bureau last year obtained benefits and debt related financial gains of nearly £3.5 million for its clients thanks to the hard work and dedication of its staff and volunteers; acknowledges that the use of client evidence allows Citizens Advice Bureaux and Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) to speak with authority and relevance on changing social issues from both a local and national perspective, such as the recent Drowning in Debt report; thanks the departing chair of CAS, the Rev Graham Blount, for his contribution over the duration of his term in office, and wishes all of Scotland’s bureaux continued success in the years to come.
