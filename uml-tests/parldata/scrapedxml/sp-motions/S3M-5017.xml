 *S3M-5017♦ Jim Hume: A Fair Deal for Scotland’s Tourism Providers—That the Parliament notes the significant direct and indirect economic contribution of B&amp;Bs, guest houses, country houses and other small-to-medium-sized holiday accommodation providers in the south of Scotland; further notes concerns expressed by many small-to-medium-sized holiday accommodation providers that, in the current restrictive financial times, these businesses could have a difficult future if they are faced with what they consider to be disproportionate red tape in the form of Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006; considers that, now more than ever, rural enterprise needs to be encouraged and that, while all businesses understand the need for fire safety, there should be a practical and proportionate balance that does not impinge on economic activity or financially penalise businesses, and hopes that, in reflecting the importance of the tourism sector in the region and across Scotland, the Scottish Government will listen to the industry and implement the legislation in a proportionate way that does not damage economic activity.
