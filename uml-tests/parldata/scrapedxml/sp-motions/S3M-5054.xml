 *S3M-5054 George Foulkes: Fireworks and Furry Friends—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal’s (SSPCA) campaign to change the law on the use of fireworks; notes that the law currently allows people to use fireworks any day of the week between the hours of 7 am and 11 pm with no regard for the impact on domestic and wild animals; notes that a dog’s hearing is twice as sensitive as a human’s and a cat’s is three times as sensitive; believes that the use of fireworks should be restricted to festivals and special events, such as 5 November, New Year’s Eve, Chinese New Year and the Hindu festival of Diwali; considers that this would ensure that pet owners could plan to keep pets indoors, and calls on the general public to ensure that fireworks are used carefully and responsibly, recognising the obvious dangers to both people and animals.
