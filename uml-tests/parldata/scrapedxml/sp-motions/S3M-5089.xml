*S3M-5089 Iain Smith: Warm Homes, Green Jobs—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Warm Homes, Green Jobs: The economic impacts of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act in the residential sector, a report by the Association for the Conservation of Energy and commissioned by eaga Scotland, which concludes that achieving a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from Scotland’s homes by 2020 could create or safeguard over 10,000 jobs, deliver an additional value to the Scottish economy of over £4 billion and contribute to lifting many Scots out of fuel poverty; notes however the report’s conclusion that these benefits will not be realised unless investment in sustainable energy rises sharply, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that Scotland does not miss out on the benefits that achieving a 42% cut in climate change pollution from our homes can deliver.
