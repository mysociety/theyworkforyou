 *S3M-5010♦ Mary Mulligan: Celebrating 15 Years of the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK—That the Parliament congratulates the Fairtrade Foundation on 15 years of activity in the United Kingdom; notes that over these 15 years, the number of licensed Fairtrade products has increased from 80 to more than 4,500; welcomes the role of the Fairtrade Foundation in securing a fair deal for farmers and producers in the developing world, ensuring that people have the right to dignity and a decent living through their work; notes that by the end of 2008, it was estimated that 70% of all households purchased at least one Fairtrade product and the total annual retail sales value of Fairtrade products exceeded £712 million, and commends local Fairtrade organisations and Scottish Fairtrade Towns such as Whitburn and Linlithgow in West Lothian for the work that they do in promoting Fairtrade Foundation principles and goods, educating others about the need for a fair deal for farmers and producers in the developing world and working to secure an international trading system that recognises the need for sustainable development and social justice.
