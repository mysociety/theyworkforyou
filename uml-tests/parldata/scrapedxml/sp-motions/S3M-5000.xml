*S3M-5000 Karen Whitefield: Plains Needs a Station—That the Parliament welcomes the recently stated commitment of the Airdrie Local Area Partnership that it remains fully supportive of a railway station at Plains; recognises that this commitment is across all political parties within North Lanarkshire Council; further recognises the benefits that such a station would provide to the people of Plains, which is an area that suffers from relatively high levels of deprivation and has low levels of car ownership, and calls on the Scottish Executive to re-examine the case for this station as a matter of urgency so that the people of Plains can benefit from the improved access to educational, employment and recreational opportunities that the Airdrie to Bathgate rail line will provide.
