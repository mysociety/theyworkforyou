 *S3M-5062 Bill Wilson: Israel’s Detention of Mohammad Othman—That the Parliament endorses calls by Jewish Voice for Peace for the release by Israel of human rights activist Mohammad Othman, arrested and detained by Israeli soldiers at the Jordan/Palestine border on his return from Norway where he was campaigning in support of the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israeli human rights abuses; notes that this non-violent campaign has the support of students, cultural workers, unionists, churches, progressive governments and sports fans throughout the world, and believes that the most effective way that the Government of Israel could remove the threat of boycott, divestment and sanctions would be by respecting human rights, accepting the findings of the report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict to the United Nations Human Rights Council and prosecuting those guilty of war crimes, releasing illegally held detainees, dismantling illegal Jewish settlements while ceasing the destruction of Palestinian homes and compensating those whose homes have been destroyed, withdrawing from the occupied territories and ending the blockade of Gaza, the continued enforcement of which has seen many civilians killed, including unarmed children reportedly shot by the Israeli Defence Force without provocation when it was not threatened. Supported by: Christine Grahame*, Robin Harper*
