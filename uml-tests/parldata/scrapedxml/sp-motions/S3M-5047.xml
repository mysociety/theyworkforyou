*S3M-5047 Rob Gibson: Pulteneytown Academy, 50 Years Young—That the Parliament congratulates Pulteneytown Academy Primary School in Wick on reaching its 50th birthday; realises that this is a golden milestone for the school and the town; recognises the hard work of the pupils, staff, teachers and head teacher, and wishes them all the best for an equally successful second half century and beyond.
