 *S3M-5085 Bill Kidd: Most Vulnerable at Risk—That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to reconsider the proposed reform of attendance allowance and is concerned that the consequences of the changes to attendance allowance, which helps severely disabled pensioners pay for the additional costs of disability, would adversely effect the most vulnerable disabled recipients of the benefit, resulting in a loss of over £70 per week, something that will potentially push thousands of pensioners into poverty or worse. Supported by: John Wilson*, Alasdair Allan*, Brian Adam*, Robin Harper*, Stuart McMillan*
