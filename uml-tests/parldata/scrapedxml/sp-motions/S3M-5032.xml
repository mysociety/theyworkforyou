 *S3M-5032 Jackie Baillie: Charities Banking on Lloyds—That the Parliament calls on the Lloyds Banking Group to provide the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland with a funding package that will enable it to continue its valuable grant-making activities in Scotland; notes that, since the establishment of the foundation in 1985, a covenant has dictated that this organisation, alongside three other autonomous foundations that cover the rest of the United Kingdom, receives a share of 1% of the Lloyds Banking Group’s pre-tax profits per annum; understands that the Lloyds Banking Group has stated that it will have no profit this year and, as such, will not be providing revenue to the foundations, although the group has offered reduced interim funding subject to changes in the structure of the foundations; supports the proposal from the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland that it receive an advance of funding, repayable over an agreed timeframe, as this will ensure that the covenant remains intact and the foundation continues to operate as a wholly independent organisation; congratulates the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland for dispensing almost £85 million to charities across Scotland since 1985, and calls on the Lloyds Banking Group to reconsider its position.
