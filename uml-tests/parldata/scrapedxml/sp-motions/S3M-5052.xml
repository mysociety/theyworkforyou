 *S3M-5052 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Chambers Harrap Publishers—That the Parliament expresses concern at the proposal by Hachette UK to close the Edinburgh headquarters of Chambers Harrap and transfer production of its profitable titles, such as The Chambers Dictionary, to London and Paris; is concerned that the closure would result in the loss of 27 jobs and end 200 years of publishing history in the city; believes that the iconic Chambers brand is closely connected to Edinburgh and that its loss will have serious consequences for the publishing industry in Scotland, and urges Hachette UK to reconsider its decision and explore all alternative avenues to retain the Chambers office in Edinburgh.
