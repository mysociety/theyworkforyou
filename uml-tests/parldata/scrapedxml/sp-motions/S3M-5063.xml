*S3M-5063 Pauline McNeill: The Scottish Parliament Welcomes Fire Fighters from Nablus—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the firefighters from Nablus who are in Scotland for three weeks to receive fire service training at the Scottish Fire Services College in Gullane, East Lothian; congratulates the Fire Brigades Union, the Scottish Government and the college for organising and supporting the project that exemplifies the fire service as a fraternity that exists across international boundaries, and believes that this type of collaboration with Palestinian public service workers is important in keeping skills up to date and will benefit ordinary citizens living in the occupied Palestinian territories.
