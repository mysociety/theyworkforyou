*S3M-4972 John Park: Upstream Oil and Gas Industry Technician Training Scheme—That the Parliament welcomes the 1,000th apprentice to complete the Upstream Oil and Gas Industry Technician Training Scheme; notes that the training scheme is the oil and gas industry’s response to the need for a competent, stable and flexible technician workforce to meet its current and future needs and is a partnership between Oil &amp; Gas UK, the Offshore Contractors Association, the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board and OPITO, - The Oil &amp; Gas Academy; further notes that the industry has invested more than £73 million in the scheme, which creates around 100 positions annually on the four-year course, and congratulates the scheme on achieving a 91% retention rate; further welcomes the development of a fully integrated industry approach to attracting new talent that provides a visible and long-term commitment to technician training in the United Kingdom, and hopes that the Upstream Oil and Gas Industry Technician Training Scheme will continue to play a vital role in securing a competent, reliable and highly skilled workforce to meet future production in the North Sea.
