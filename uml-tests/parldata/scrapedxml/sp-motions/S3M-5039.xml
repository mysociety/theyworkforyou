 *S3M-5039 Richard Baker: Congratulations to Grampian Police on Scottish Policing Awards Success—That the Parliament congratulates Grampian Police on winning nine prizes at the inaugural Scottish Policing Awards held at the Scottish Police College on 20 October 2009; notes that the awards are designed to recognise the work done by police forces across the country and to celebrate exceptional initiatives run by officers and staff; congratulates the force on its success in receiving an outstanding contribution award for the pioneering development of a missing persons profiling toolkit; congratulates the force also on winning five highly commended awards for a number of other high profile initiatives, including cracking down on street-level drug dealers, targeting young antisocial driving and a racism and homophobia awareness-raising project for young people; believes that the force’s success at the Scottish Policing Awards reflects its commitment to delivering an outstanding service to the communities of north-east Scotland; believes that the nine awards are testament to the excellent standard of innovation, determination and professionalism demonstrated by Grampian Police staff, all of whom are helping to make a tangible difference to policing in the north east, and pays tribute to the hard work of all involved.
