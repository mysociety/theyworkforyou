*S3M-4995 Linda Fabiani: The Tobin Tax—That the Parliament notes the recent comments by Lord Adair Turner, Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, that options such as a tax on international financial transactions (the Tobin tax) should be considered in the debate on future regulation of financial systems; notes that the Tobin tax was originally proposed in the early 1970s by James Tobin, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, who argued that a small tax levied on currency exchanges could discourage short-term currency speculation without being a burden on trade, and considers that this would be a worthwhile option for the UK Government to discuss with its international counterparts with a view to developing a more stable global financial system that discourages speculative transactions that are of no social benefit.
