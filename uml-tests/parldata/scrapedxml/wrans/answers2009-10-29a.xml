	<p pid="a.483W.6/3">Following receipt of a claim, a Jobcentre Plus decision maker will decide whether the claimant satisfies the occupational criteria for the prescribed disease.

The doctor will, through a combination of history and examination findings, provide advice to the decision maker as to whether the condition is diagnosed, and if it is, on the level of disablement with reference to a person of the same age and sex whose physical and mental condition is normal.</p>

This database compares a range of packaging solutions used for the same product and ranks them from the lightest to the heaviest. We encourage all users of packaging to make use of this data when specifying packaging. Action on the basis of this information is often taken at the sector level through voluntary agreements e.g. the Courtauld Commitment, or can be taken by individual packaging producers.</p>

As a result, the driver is required, in common with other drivers who have a second job, to declare it as a period of other work and ensure that the required daily and weekly rest periods are taken.</p>

It would therefore not be appropriate for Government to specify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions reductions expected from each authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.498W.6/1">The &quot;loss&quot; of television channels to some viewers has occurred not because of the digital switchover, but because of a national re-tune. The Broadcasters decided to go ahead with the re-organisation of the Freeview platform in order to make space for the introduction of new technology to enable High Definition services on the digital terrestrial television (or Freeview) platform. It has also increased the availability of Channel Five to the point where it can now be received in almost all households across the UK&mdash;98.5 per cent. An estimated 500,000 Freeview homes will be able to see Channel Five for the first time after re-tuning.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.6/2">Around 78,000 viewers in Wales, who receive their transmissions via a relay station, may have lost access to ITV 3 or ITV 4 following the re-tune but many viewers will of course have gained Channel Five and HD capability. These channels are not necessarily permanently unavailable as there are alternative means of accessing both. Viewers can find out how to do so by contacting Digital UK via their website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.500W.0/1">The decision by the Ascension Island Government to remove a variation in the Ministry of Defence's annual property tax liability, which had the effect of almost doubling the amount, is currently being disputed. The MOD, therefore, has not paid this new tax liability in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.500W.0/2">Discussions are ongoing in order to seek an agreement that is fair and equitable, and assurance that the services received from the Ascension Island Government represent best value for money. The Ascension Island Council has commissioned an HMRC-led study, supported by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, into tax arrangements on Ascension Island. The Ministry of Defence is being consulted as part of this study.</p>

	<p pid="a.500W.6/2">When movement is by commercial airline, as opposed to MOD charter or part-charter, class of travel is determined by the length of flight and the rank or civil service grade of the passenger. The majority of armed forces and civilian personnel will travel economy, tourist or budget class. Only when flights are longer than 2.5 hours will the passenger be entitled to travel club, executive, new economy, ambassador or premier economy. Two star officers and above and two star senior civil service and above, will mostly travel by club, executive, business, new economy, ambassador or premier. However, when this class of travel is not available, the flight is longer than 2.5 hours, and this is the only method of travel available to meet with designated service priorities, then the passenger is entitled to travel first class.</p>
	<p pid="a.500W.6/3">For rail and sea travel, most will travel by standard class. However, officers and civil servants who are Lieutenant Commander, Major, Squadron Leader, pay band C2 and above, travelling on duty, are entitled to first class travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.500W.6/4">Regardless of entitlement, though, all personnel are strongly encouraged to use the most economic means of travel at all times.</p>

We are clear that in order to retain its GSP+ preferences Sri Lanka must respect its international human rights obligations under GSP+.</p>

	<p pid="a.511W.0/1">Incandescent lighting on the parliamentary estate has been gradually replaced with lower energy lighting over the last five years, mostly during routine lamp changes. Therefore, the only cost of compliance has been the cost of the bulbs themselves which is offset by their increased life and will begin to produce savings within 500 hours of use. Due to the size and complexity of the estate, detailed records of light bulbs are not kept, but virtually no incandescent lighting remains within areas <i> (a)</i> the Chamber and <i> (b)</i> the Press Gallery. In <i> (c)</i>, areas open to the public, the vast majority of incandescent light bulbs have been replaced over the last 12 months with halogen lamps which consume some 30 per cent. less power. On <i> (d)</i>, the remainder of the Commons part of the estate, the only incandescent light fittings that the House has been unable to replace are those using small bayonet caps as these are not currently available. LED lighting is also currently being evaluated in several locations and low energy induction lighting is used widely such as in the Chamber and courtyards.</p>

	<p pid="a.516W.2/2">Between 2008-11, Government are investing approximately &pound;25.5 million into a new network of 225 Competition Managers (CMs), all of which have been recruited. The new network of CMs will provide better opportunities for young people to take part in competitive sport; and ensure that school-based opportunities are more integrated with national governing bodies' competition pathway priorities and club competitions. Their objective is to increase the number of young people engaged in regular high quality inter-school competitive events.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.2/3">Government are also investing approximately &pound;3 million between 2008-11 into an intra-school competition programme called 'yoURsport'. This is being implemented by the 450 school sport partnerships and is targeted at less sporty pupils to encourage them to participate in competitive sporting activity. The programme's objectives are to increase participation in intra-school competition for all young people aged 11 to 16, by providing a competitive experience which is appealing and accessible. The programme also provides opportunities for young leaders to deploy their leadership skills in organising, staging and officiating intra-school competition for their peers.</p>

	<p pid="a.532W.2/1">The information requested is given in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.2/2">It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the percentage change in detection rates have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.2/3">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstance. In terms of offences detected by the police, the preferred measure is now to use sanction detections.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.2/4">Detection rates are a ratio of crime detected in a period to crimes recorded in a period. They are not based on tracking whether individual crimes recorded in period have eventually been detected.</p>

Different amounts are available for each type of grant. Figures contain students in each year of their courses. The amount a student receives depends on household income, year of entry to higher education and personal circumstances.</p>

These include: creating 70 per cent. additional telephone lines; adding 144 staff to answer phones, as well as more staff working overtime at the SLC and its outsource providers, increasing call centre operating capacity by around 35 per cent.; reminding students that they can check the status of their application online; and making improvements to answers to the most common enquiries on the internet, and directing callers to these via a recorded telephone message.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.6/2">The following table provides a response to the questions related to underlying funds that have received funding from the UKHTF; the monetary value of investments from the UKHTF to underlying funds in each year since 2001; and, how much funding remains available for future funding of underlying funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.6/3">The number of companies receiving investment through UKHTF was lower in 2007 and 2008 than in 2006 as a natural consequence of the underlying funds entering their post investment period where the focus was towards managing out and exiting the existing portfolio.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.6/4">Unfortunately the information requested in this question about cost of management fees related to UKHTF is commercially sensitive at this time in light of work BIS is undertaking to source a fund of funds manager for the UK Innovation Investment Fund (UKIIF). The information will be released once the UKIIF fund of funds manager is appointed and this is likely to happen at the end of December.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.6/5">We are unable to answer the question about how much funding remains available in underlying funds which have received funding from UKHTF for future investments in business, as this goes beyond the Department's interaction with the fund of funds manager.</p>

Since then, 11 terrorist offenders have been released to approved premises. Data about offenders released into approved premises (formerly known as bail/probation hostels) is collected centrally, from information supplied by individual approved premises. The data collected does not include offence details more generally.

Where offenders are registered as CPPCs, areas may apply for additional funding to strengthen local risk management plans: Such funding can cover temporary additional staffing in approved premises, a member of staff to escort offenders outside the approved premises, improvements to security equipment at approved premises or other specific interventions which contribute to public protection.</p>

	<p pid="a.566W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Jil Matheson, dated October 2009:</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what account was taken of the process and results of the 2001 Census in deciding which religions to list on the 2011 Census; and what criteria were used to determine the list. (295047)</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/4" class="indent">The religion question was introduced in the 2001 Census as a voluntary question and has been designed to collect information on religious affiliation, which is required by many users of census statistics for monitoring equality and planning of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/5" class="indent">Question development for the 2011 Census began in 2005 and since then the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has consulted and engaged with a large number of census users including those from central, regional and local government, academia, community groups and organisations to determine their requirements for topics and questions in the 2011 Census. In addition, a. detailed specific consultation was conducted in 2006/7 to refine the user requirements for information on ethnic group, national identity, religion and language questions for the 2011 Census. As a suite of questions they provide the opportunity for individual respondents to indicate their identity in the ways they consider most appropriate, and which ONS will be able to measure in the most statistically relevant way to meet the expressed needs of users. Consultation revealed a high demand for a religion question and the majority of responses indicated a requirement for comparability with the 2001 Census question.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/6" class="indent">The tick-box categories used in the 2001 Census continue to represent the largest religious groups and have been repeated in all testing of the religion question. The 'none' tick-box has been renamed 'no religion' and been put first in the list to ensure that people who do not have a religious affiliation are aware that the question provides an appropriate response category. There is insufficient space on the questionnaire to include additional tick-boxes. However, Census outputs based on the write-in answers for those religions not specifically identified by tick boxes will be produced to meet user requirements. Consultation on the form and content of outputs from the 2011 Census is now underway.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/7" class="indent">The Draft Census (England and Wales) Order setting out the information to be collected in the 2011 Census was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-21">21 October</phrase>. To coincide with the laying of the Census Order, additional material covering the recommendations for questions to be asked in the 2011 Census has been placed on the census website at:</p>

This year, DFID and the SAF will each contribute &pound;5 million to reach almost 40,000 farmers, including 2,200 in Sangin.

	<p pid="a.574W.5/1">The Government of Sudan's decision to expel 13 international and close down 3 national NGOs in March this year has had a detrimental effect on the delivery of assistance to the people of South Kordofan and Eastern Sudan. Health facilities, water and sanitation projects and livelihood programmes run by these organisations have either lost support or have been discontinued.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.5/2">As with Darfur, the ability to respond to future emergencies&mdash;such as floods or conflict&mdash;is now much lower in these areas. The effects of the expulsions are most acutely felt in the delivery of recovery and basic services programmes. Since March, several NGOs have been trying to expand or establish new programmes to cover these gaps. In particular, Mercy Corps Scotland, Care Switzerland, and Save the Children&mdash;Sweden plan to scale up programmes in South Kordofan. However, the Sudan Government has been slow to grant the necessary permits and it is unlikely that new programmes will be fully operational for some months.</p>

	<p pid="a.576W.6/1">When the Thalidomide Trust was set up in 1974, it was subject to the same rules that govern payments from all discretionary trusts. Under those rules, payments from Trust income counted towards the victims' taxable income and also reduced their level of entitlement to tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.6/2">In 2004, following consultation with the then Inland Revenue, the trust agreed to change the way it makes payments to victims so that they could be classified as &quot;periodical&quot; payments and potentially fall within the scope of legislation governing &quot;structured settlements&quot;. The Treasury were then able to make use of a power bringing those periodical payments by the trustees to Thalidomide victims within the scope of a relief aimed at structured damages settlements arrived at by agreement between the parties or by order of a court.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.6/3">The new legislation took effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-05">5 August 2004</phrase>, after which payments from the trust to victims have not counted as income for the purposes of calculating the victims' income tax liabilities or their entitlement to tax credits.</p>

	<p pid="a.582W.8/1">National health service organisations provide car parking to patients and visitors based on their local plans, needs and circumstances. Therefore, the details of implementing free car parking for in-patients will vary between different NHS organisations including the proportion that can be afforded in each year and which back-office costs will be reduced. However, all NHS organisations are expected to have fully implemented the change within three years. The improved concession guidance will benefit out-patients by stressing the importance of tangible concessions for regular users, particularly out-patients, and by ensuring that all eligible patients are made fully aware of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.8/2">The estimate of annual cost per annum for phasing out in-patient car parking of &pound;141 million was based on two figures. The direct cost of in-patient parking was based on the number of bed days recorded for elective, emergency and maternity care with each of the bed days resulting in two hours parking at the national average cost of visitor car parking per hour of &pound;1.00 giving a total of &pound;93 million. In addition, the impact of the NHS paying for private finance initiative and other commercial agreements was estimated at an additional &pound;48 million.</p>

Time spent using the system is relatively short, and in most care settings, users will log in and log out of the system repeatedly throughout the day.</p>

	<p pid="a.583W.8/1">An appropriate diet, based on acceptable standards, requires good food with the right nutritional content, properly prepared and available when patients need it. The NHS Plan stipulated that dieticians should advise and check on nutritional values in hospital food and this role is undertaken locally by staff in national health service trusts. The assessment of the nutritional requirements of post-natal mothers who are breast feeding is a matter for local determination and the Department does not collect any data centrally.</p>

It is for each local authority to shape the services they provide to meet the needs of their local population. Where a local authority identifies a child who requires support, including those that have been trafficked, they are then responsible for identifying appropriate services to meet their needs, including being kept safe from any likely significant harm.</p>

	<p pid="a.593W.3/1">The Government allocated &pound;35.5 million for family intervention projects in 2009-10 and are planning to allocate &pound;57.1 million Government funding in 2010-11, an increase of 61 per cent. In addition there is anticipated match funding of &pound;9.5 million from Registered Social Landlords, Housing Associations and Youth Offending Teams. Departmental budgets, and therefore the funding for Family Intervention Projects, have yet to be determined beyond March 2011. Decisions will be made following Spending Review discussions once the Department's settlement is agreed.</p>

	<p pid="a.595W.2/5">Interim changes were introduced into the STPCD from September 2009 to reflect emerging leadership models, including recognition for heads who become responsible for running more than one school either on a permanent or temporary basis. The provisions in the STPCD provide for employers to determine a salary for heads who take on responsibility for running more than one school that is above the top of the leadership pay spine (&pound;109,658 in Inner London and &pound;102,734 elsewhere). It is a matter for individual employers to determine the appropriate salary that takes account of the nature and challenge of the responsibilities associated with running more than one school.</p>

	<p pid="a.602W.2/20">The revenue per pupil figures shown in table 2 is taken from the dedicated schools grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 (in table 1 above) because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.2/21">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on education formula spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.2/22">To provide a comparison for 2008-09 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06 (the baseline); as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year. The per pupil revenue funding figures for 2005-06 to 2008-09 (in financial years) for local authorities in the East of England are provided in table 2. The figures are for all funded pupils aged three to19 and are in real terms.</p>

	<p pid="a.603W.2/12">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the new dedicated schools grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 2004-05 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.2/13">The 2004-05 to 2005-06 figures are based on education formula spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the local government finance settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.2/14">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above, this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.2/15">The per pupil revenue funding figures for years 2005-06 (baseline) to 2008-09 for Birmingham local authority are provided in the following table. As the DSG is a mechanism for distributing funding, a split between primary and secondary schools is not available. The following figures are for all funded pupils aged three to 19 and are in real terms.</p>

	<p pid="a.605W.5/1">Central Government funding to support local provision of school places is decided some time in advance, partly because of the time needed for the building of new capacity and partly to respond to local authorities' longstanding plea for a degree of funding certainty. So the central Government decisions on allocating capital funding for school places in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were made some time ago, using pupil number forecasts provided to my Department from local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.5/2">Over the last few months, it has become clear that in some localities the rise in child population has been steeper than had been allowed for. So on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-15">15 July</phrase>, we announced an allocation of &pound;200 million for authorities which are experiencing and forecasting exceptionally high rates of growth in demand for reception places to 2011, to support the provision of permanent places where there is greatest need. DCSF is currently appraising applications and aims to make an announcement shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.607W.5/1">As the key universal service for children, schools play an important role in the promotion of better emotional health and resilience and early intervention where mental health problems may arise. There are a number of programmes in schools that increase awareness of mental health issues for children and young people. These include the Healthy Schools Programme and Targeted Mental Health in Schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.607W.5/2">The Healthy Schools Programme requires schools to have policies and practices in place to support emotional health and wellbeing, including identifying children at risk of experiencing behavioural, emotional or social difficulties. Currently 99 per cent. of schools in England are working towards or have achieved Healthy School status.</p>
	<p pid="a.607W.5/3">The Targeted Mental Health in Schools (TaMHS) programme is developing models of mental health support in schools for those children, young people and their families who need it most. The project includes training for school staff to equip them with the knowledge and ability to identify problems early, to work with and support children and young people at risk of experiencing mental health problems and to refer them to appropriate mental health professionals, as necessary. It also provides mental health awareness and promotion for children, young people and families. Funded by &pound;60 million between 2008 and 2011, the programme is currently operating in 80 local authorities. From September 2010 TaMHS will be operating in clusters of schools in all areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.607W.5/4">There are other school based programmes that also promote better emotional wellbeing. Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) is a comprehensive voluntary programme to develop the social and emotional skills of all pupils, while the new personal wellbeing programme of study within Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education includes a specific focus on issues relating to emotional wellbeing and mental health.</p>

	<p pid="a.608W.2/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM chief inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to my right hon. Friend and a copy of her reply has been placed in the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-23">23 October 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/4" class="indent">Ofsted does not have a judgement which relates directly to 'respect for others'. The inspection judgement that most closely approximates to 'respect for others' is 'The extent of learners' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development'. In forming the judgement, inspectors take account of:</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/5" class="indent">Learners' response to spiritual and moral issues, such as their attitudes to bullying, and their effective discussion in lessons</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/6" class="indent">the quality of learners' social development as expressed through their relationships with their peers and with adults</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/7" class="indent">learners' understanding of Britain as a diverse society and their readiness to engage with others from a different cultural background</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/8" class="indent">the extent to which they embrace the shared values of the community and contribute to its cohesiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/9" class="indent">Under the school inspection frameworks used between January 2000 and August 2005 (commonly known as section 10), the school's overall effectiveness judgement was made using a seven point scale: excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, poor and very poor. From September 2005 to September 2009, the overall effectiveness judgement was made under the school inspection framework commonly known as Section 5, using a four point scale: outstanding, good, satisfactory and inadequate. It is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach from 2000 to the present, using these different systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/10" class="indent">The latest period for which published figures are available is the spring term 2008/09. This answer, therefore, takes into account all inspections carried out prior to <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-03">3 April 2009</phrase>. At that time, there were still some schools that had not yet been inspected under the section 5 framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/11" class="indent">For the purposes of answering this question, excellent or very good are interpreted as being analogous to outstanding as defined under the Section 5 inspection framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/12" class="indent">Of all the schools open on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-04">4 April 2009</phrase> and having received an Ofsted inspection, 35% were judged as outstanding under section 5, or as excellent or very good under section 10, at their last inspection in respect of 'the extent of learners' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development'.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/13" class="indent">Of all Roman Catholic schools open on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-04">4 April 2009</phrase> and having received an Ofsted inspection, 51% were judged as outstanding under section 5, or as excellent or very good under section 10, at their last inspection in respect of 'the extent of learners' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development'.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/14" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Vernon Coaker MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and placed in the library of both Houses.</p>
