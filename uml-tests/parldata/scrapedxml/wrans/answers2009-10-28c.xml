	<p pid="c.349W.3/2">The six scenarios discussed in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase> were compared with a 'business as usual' scenario, during the development of the Renewable Energy Strategy to assess the additional air quality impacts of possible approaches to biomass heat uptake. It was found that the impact on concentrations of nitrogen dioxide was negligible on a national basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.349W.3/3">The impacts on morbidity resulting from the uptake of biomass as a renewable energy source were not assessed during the analyses.</p>
	<p pid="c.349W.3/4">The initial analysis of mortality for scenario 1 and 2 used an alternative approach to valuing the air quality impact which was not directly comparable in its intermediate assessment of mortality although the resulting monetise health costs are comparable.</p>
	<p pid="c.349W.3/5">An intermediate stage in the analysis of scenarios 3 to 6 was the calculation of the mortality resulting from the increment in particulate matter (PM10) concentrations in ambient air. The results of this stage of the analysis are shown in the following table. The analysis is subject to considerable uncertainty in the underlying assumptions. Including the time delay between the exposure to the air pollution and the resulting health impact. The values presented for Scenarios 3 to 6 represent the central case within this uncertainty. Other uncertainties include the biomass emissions, the spatial distribution of biomass uptake and the valuation methodology. The results presented are for the whole of the UK and are given in their raw output form.</p>

The proposed amendment would clarify that wind turbines can be constructed in flood risk areas, subject to demonstrating that the turbines would be safe, without increasing flood risk elsewhere and, if proposed for a functional flood plain, would be designed to remain operational during a flood, result in no net loss of flood plain storage and not impede water flows.</p>

	<p pid="c.364W.11/2" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.364W.11/3">Foreign drivers are subject to the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts at all times when driving on British roads. They are therefore liable to prosecution for contravention of the legislation. It is for individual chief officers of police to decide what action should be taken against foreign drivers detected speeding by mobile or static speed cameras.</p>
	<p pid="c.364W.11/4">We have taken a number of measures to improve enforcement action against the drivers of non UK registered vehicles. These include a provision in the Road Safety Act 2006 which will allow the exchange of driver licensing and vehicle registration information with other countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.364W.11/5">Further help will be provided by the European Framework Decision on the Mutual Recognition of Financial Penalties, which will allow penalties imposed by courts in one member state to be enforced in another and by the International Convention on the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications. The growing use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras, is also helping enforcement against foreign offenders detected speeding and jumping red lights, since a person who succeeds in leaving the country without being dealt with for such an offence can have their vehicle's number-plate recorded on a database and so be detected and dealt with on return here.</p>

In conjunction with the medical experts on the Secretary of State for Transport's Honorary Advisory Panels, we are considering what to do in those cases where the revised standards are lower than those currently applied in the UK. In these cases we must determine whether the stricter standards should remain in force, in the interests of road safety.

	<p pid="c.368W.6/2">In order to be better informed about the likely consequences of allowing longer and/or heavier goods vehicles on the English road network, the Department for Transport commissioned a study which reported in 2008. The report of this study: &quot;Longer and/or Longer and Heavier Goods Vehicles (LHVs) - A study of the likely effects if permitted in the UK&quot; (reference: TRL Report PPR 285), concluded that allowing longer and/or heavier vehicles onto the network could lead to an increase in CO2 emissions. The report also concluded that there would be a limited impact on the structural performance of pavements and bridges but did not cover the specific issue of the likely effect on the annual cost of maintaining the road network.</p>

	<p pid="c.368W.12/2"><i> </i>On <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-23">23 July</phrase> the Government announced a major &pound;1.1 billion programme of rail electrification, including the electrification by 2013 of the line between Liverpool and Manchester via Newton-le-Willows.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.12/3">Electrification of the Liverpool-Manchester route via Newton-le-Willows will enable the operation of high-capacity four-carriage electric trains transferred from the cross-London Thameslink route. These trains will be completely modernised before they are transferred, including the installation of air-conditioning.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.12/4">This additional capacity on the Liverpool-Manchester line running via Newton-le-Willows will relieve pressure on the other Liverpool-Manchester line running via Warrington.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.12/5">The diesel trains currently operating on the Liverpool-Manchester line via Newton-le-Willows will be transferred onto other routes, delivering much needed additional capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.12/6">In the meantime, the Department for Transport is in discussion with train operating companies about delivering additional capacity. This includes discussions with Northern Rail about a first phase of additional rolling stock. The Government will publish an updated rolling stock plan taking account of electrification and setting out a revised strategy this autumn.</p>

	<p pid="c.371W.5/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) support to India's National Tuberculosis Control Programme has been highly effective. The programme has averted an estimated 180,000 deaths a year since 2005. That is around 500 lives saved in India every day. DFID's support has helped put 1.5 million TB patients on treatment every year in India.</p>
	<p pid="c.371W.5/2">Our support has ensured that India has faced no drug shortage, despite having the most rapidly expanding TB programme in the world. By March 2006 the programme had been scaled up to cover the entire country. Since 1997 the success rate for TB treatment has tripled from 25 per cent. to 86 per cent. and TB deaths rates have been cut seven-fold from 29 per cent. to 4 per cent.</p>

They have worked with Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) public servants to carry out a full review of the TCI Government's finances. Measures have been put in place to limit public expenditure, increase revenue and bring the Islands' debt under control. These have been included in a new budget which also reflects the restructuring of the public service. The rationale behind the new budget is to provide breathing space for the introduction of the more fundamental reforms needed to ensure transparency, accountability and sustainability in the management of public finances.</p>

	<p pid="c.387W.6/2">No assessment has been made of the adequacy and effectiveness of the regulatory regime affecting off-road bikes. There is a range of powers available to tackle the misuse of off-road bikes, such as restrictions on legal use, warnings from a police officer for riding antisocially, and seizing and crushing bikes if riders ignore warnings.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.6/3">Three independent reports have confirmed our approach to tackling antisocial behaviour is working. The National Audit Office reported that two thirds of people stop committing ASB after one intervention rising to nine out of 10 ceasing after three interventions. The Home Office has commissioned an evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of ASB interventions. It is expected to report in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="c.392W.2/1">VisitBritain's budget was set in 2007, in the context of expected efficiencies through increased and better use of technology, changing priorities with new and emerging markets, internal restructuring and more focused marketing. The Department does not therefore believe there has been a direct impact from this on international visitor numbers. Visitor numbers have, however, been affected by the global downturn as they have in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.392W.2/2">The United Nations World Tourism Organisation estimates that total global arrivals will decline by between 4 and 6 per cent. in 2009, and VisitBritain has forecast that the number of international visitors to the UK could decline by up to 5 per cent. in 2009. In the first eight months of 2009, 9 per cent. fewer overseas visitors came to the UK compared to the same period in 2008. However, overseas visitors' spend over this period is only 1 per cent . lower than in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.392W.2/3">VisitBritain invested &pound;3.5 million in a 'Value for Money Campaign' during the spring and summer of 2009 to encourage more inward bound tourism. The campaign emphasised favourable currency exchange rates and the very high quality of the tourism offer in this country.</p>

Instead, as part of the strategy's overall move towards offering five hours of PE and Sport for young people in schools and other settings, the survey measured participation in at least three hours of PE and out of hours sport each week in schools for the first time.

	<p pid="c.396W.3/1">The National Offender Management Service, the Ministry of Defence and third sector partners, have made significant progress in further developing the range of services and support available for veterans who have offended. New posters and leaflets have been distributed in order to promote the support that is on offer to veterans in prison and after release. Prison officers have been given access to the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency website and, where Governors allow, prisoners have direct access to their free helpline. Charities providing support have access to veterans for welfare visits which do not count against prisoners' personal visits allowance.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.3/2">A guide for prison officers working with veterans is under development this has been informed by good practice in existence in a number of prisons and work is in progress to prepare instructions for probation staff supervising ex-service personnel, in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.3/3">New IT based offender assessment procedures include questioning to identify offenders who have served in the armed forces. This is in the early stages of roll out across the prison estate and will be fully implemented by May 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.3/4">While we acknowledge that we are currently unable to identify all of those prisoners who are veterans, we are confident that assessment at induction will signpost offenders, according to need, to the range of generic interventions that are available. This will include mental health in-reach, referral to the Medical Assessment Programme at St. Thomas' Hospital providing specialist health assessment for veterans and referral to Combat Stress Treatment Centres for help with anxiety management, post traumatic stress, sleep disorder and grief. To complement this, the Prison Service provides a range of 14 Offending Behaviour Programmes, six Drug Programmes and a therapeutic community at Grendon prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.3/5">Work is ongoing to quantify the numbers of armed forces veterans in the criminal justice system. Data matching will begin during November and we will disseminate the numbers identified by December. Discussions are underway with a view to extending this to encompass offenders serving community sentences. We anticipate that the data will enable us to examine some of the paths into offending, make decisions about whether more specific services need to be developed and provide more targeted support.</p>

	<p pid="c.401W.2/1">Figures are only available for the last nine years, since the Access to Justice Act came in. Information is not held on the number of practitioners at each firm and instead shows the number of solicitor offices providing legal aid services each year.</p>
	<p pid="c.401W.2/2">Prior to the introduction of the civil unified contract in April 2007 and criminal unified contract in July 2008, legal aid providers delivering services in more than one office would hold separate contracts for each of those offices. The Legal Services Commission (LSC) now contracts with legal aid firms but each firm may have several offices. The office then holds a schedule or schedules that enable it to undertake work in each category of law. Therefore, from the introduction of the unified contracts, the total figures do not represent the total number of offices.</p>
	<p pid="c.401W.2/3">Over the period there has been a downward trend in the overall number of solicitor offices dealing with legal aid. This is because there has been a continuing process of offices that do only small amounts of legal aid work leaving the market or merging with other offices, so that the work is done in larger volumes at fewer offices. In addition, the Legal Services Commission has over time sought to terminate dormant accounts where no work was being done.</p>
	<p pid="c.401W.2/4">The figures requested are available in the following tables.</p>

	<p pid="c.405W.0/1">Following consultation, the LSC proposed that consortium arrangements should only be permitted for core social welfare law categories such as debt, housing and welfare benefits. This was in order to ensure that integrated services can be provided for people who will often have multiple problems. In immigration cases, the necessary services are capable of being delivered by single providers; therefore there is not the need to allow consortium bids.</p>
	<p pid="c.405W.0/2">Providers will be able to bid for asylum and immigration new matter starts as part of the 2010 process and the number of starts available will vary from area to area according to demand. Providers will be required to do a minimum volume of cases in each area of law (except in Devon where only non-asylum starts will be made available).</p>

	<p pid="c.420W.2/2">Evidence and experience has proven that acceptable healthy meals can be provided in prisons within this level of funding by carefully managing menu content and using key messages from the Department of Health about promoting a healthy diet.</p>

	<p pid="c.420W.5/1">The National Offender Management Service's (NOMS') Standards Audit provides assurance to the Director General and senior managers on the management of risk throughout the service. This is done through objective measurement of performance against standards in establishments and courts. This process supports continuous improvement and informs the issue and review of standards, the dissemination of good practice and implementation of policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/2">The standards which establishments are required to meet are specified in Performance Standard 60, Suicide and Self Harm Reduction. Auditing of establishments' performance against Standard 60 is carried out independently by NOMS' Standards Audit.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/3">NOMS has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This requires proactively identifying prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. At-risk prisoners are cared for using Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures.</p>

	<p pid="c.421W.2/1">Figures on the number of children born and subsequently separated from their mother while in custody are not collected centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.421W.2/2">Mothers who have their children with them in custody will be located in a Mother and Baby Unit (MBU). Babies can remain with their mothers on an MBU up to the age of 18 months, and a condition of admission to an MBU is that a separation plan is agreed between the mother and the care team. The child will leave the MBU when it is considered to be in their best interest. Ideally the process of separation will be voluntary, gradually staged and, wherever possible, conducted over a period of time known and clearly understood by all parties involved. The desirable scenario is that a mother and child will leave an MBU together when the mother is released from prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.421W.2/3">Not all mothers who give birth in custody keep their children with them. This may be because Social Services have made the decision in the child's best interests that mother and child should be separated at birth, or because the mother has decided that the child should be cared for by a relative or friend. It may also be because the mother has been refused a place on an MBU, and if this is the case the application process will have involved Social Services and liaison will be maintained with them and the family in determining the future care of the child.</p>

	<p pid="c.444W.2/1">National health service acute trusts have undertaken the Care Quality Commission's annual in-patient survey of patients (2008), which includes questions relating to; patients' rating of the food, whether they were offered a choice and whether they received help to eat meals. The most recent survey (2008 national adult inpatients survey [published May 2009]) results show a positive improvement in patient satisfaction with hospital food, i.e. a two-percentage point increase in food rated &quot;very good&quot;, and a fall in the number who rate the food as &quot;poor&quot;. Also, it shows a three-percentage point increase in patients stating that they always received &quot;enough help from staff to eat meals&quot;. The Care Quality Commission's mental health acute inpatient service users' survey (2009), also asks respondents how they rate the hospital food.</p>
	<p pid="c.444W.2/2">The importance of good quality food for patients is recognised, both in terms of improving their health and in relation to their overall experience of services.</p>
	<p pid="c.444W.2/3">The Better Hospital Food programme focused on ensuring the consistent delivery of high quality food and food services to patients and its key outputs include; best practice guidance and detailed information to support the delivery of food in the NHS. Although the Better Hospital Food programme has now closed, the resource is still available via the Hospital Caterers' Association website:</p>
	<p pid="c.444W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hospitalcaterers.org">www.hospitalcaterers.org</a></p>
	<p pid="c.444W.2/5">The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), is also working with stakeholders in the development of a toolkit to assist NHS organisations in the implementation of the &quot;10 Key Characteristics of Good Nutritional Care&quot;. The factsheets support good nutritional care and were published by the NPSA earlier this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.444W.5/2">This cost relates to the average daily cost for the provision of all meals and beverages fed to one patient per day, across all NHS trusts in England.

	<p pid="c.455W.0/1">No guidance regarding the number of lavatories to be provided in new buildings has been issued specifically to local planning authorities and planning regulations do not cover this area. However, current Building Regulations, in Part G (Hygiene), require that &quot;adequate sanitary conveniences&quot; are provided in new buildings. The accompanying guidance contained in Approved Document G draws attention to the fact that the number of appliances may be subject to other legislation, for example, on workplaces, but that British Standard 6465, Part 1: 1984 also provides a basis for showing compliance with the requirement.</p>
	<p pid="c.455W.0/2">Changes to Part G of the Building Regulations will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase> and draft guidance has been issued. The revised guidance, in reference to buildings other than dwellings, states that the minimum number of sanitary conveniences for staff in workplaces, including separate provision for men and women, should be in accord with the Approved Code of Practice that supports the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992. The Approved Document also refers to the alternative guidance set out in BS 6465:2006 for those building types not covered by the Approved Code of Practice or in workplaces where the applicant wishes to provide more than that minimum level.</p>

Local authorities have powers under Section 20 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 to require toilets to be provided and maintained for public use in any place providing entertainment, exhibitions or sporting events, and places serving food and drink for consumption on the premises, but it is for each authority to determine how these powers should be applied according to the circumstances of each case.</p>

	<p pid="c.458W.6/1">Until July 2008, the Department operated a decentralised payment processing model, with business areas processing supplier invoices independently of each other and the &quot;centre&quot;. This arrangement was inherently inefficient, allowing delays and errors in the processing of payments, which in turn contributed to a low performance against Whitehall prompt payment targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.458W.6/2">In July 2008 the Department introduced centralised processing of invoices, resulting in a more effective and efficient means of handling, authorising and paying supplier accounts rendered. This change in approach had an immediate positive impact on performance, which improved steadily through the reporting year. Clearance of an inherited backlog of unpaid invoices had an impact on payment performance. The introduction across Whitehall of a 10 day prompt payment policy in December 2008 provided a further impetus for improvement, and processes were further automated and streamlined to meet the new challenges.</p>
	<p pid="c.458W.6/3">In the current financial year these process enhancements have continued and the further exploitation of technology continues to generate improvements against the Whitehall 10 day prompt payment target, raising current performance to above 90 per cent. of valid invoices being paid within 10 days of receipt. The comparable figure for the resource account in the current financial year is above 95per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.460W.0/1">People's perceptions of public risk often differ from actual levels of risk. These distorted public perceptions may encourage poor policy-making and unnecessary laws, leading people to feel that Government is interfering too much in their lives. Strong leadership from the Government is necessary to counter these trends and to help foster a more considered approach to risk and public policy making. In handling public risk, Communities and Local Government follows the guidance of the Risk and Regulation Advisory Council by placing emphasis on understanding the risk in context, actively engaging with a broad community, and effective communication.</p>

However, Communities and Local Government published joint guidance with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency entitled Improving the flood performance of new buildings&mdash;Flood resilient construction in May 2007. The document provides guidance to developers and designers on how to improve the flood resilience of new properties in low or residual flood risk areas by the use of suitable materials and construction details. To help achieve resilient design it suggests that, for ground floors, electrical sockets should be installed above flood level to minimise damage to electrical services.</p>
