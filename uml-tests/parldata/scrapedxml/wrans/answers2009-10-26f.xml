	<p pid="f.11W.2/1">The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) plans to offer the off-road practical motorcycling test from five Multi-Purpose Test Centres (MPTCs) in the south west: in Redruth, Taunton, Plymouth, Exeter, and Bristol. MPTCs are already fully operational in three of these areas, at Plymouth, Exeter and Bristol and DSA is in negotiation with private developers and local planning authorities regarding the provision at Taunton and Redruth.</p>
	<p pid="f.11W.2/2">In the meantime temporary Module 1 facilities have been provided at existing Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) test stations in Camborne and Taunton. The operational requirements of VOSA and the need to avoid any conflict between motorcycle candidates and lorries mean that these two facilities are open for Module 1 testing only at weekends.</p>

	<p pid="f.27W.5/1">Defence Estates works closely with all of its repair and maintenance contractors to ensure that levels of service continually improves and that repair jobs are completed within required timescales and to an acceptable standard of workmanship.</p>
	<p pid="f.27W.5/2">As an example, in England and Wales, to improve the maintenance and repair of service accommodation, personal digital assistants (PDA) will be introduced to allow better access to information about the property, including details of previous jobs. Among other benefits, this should ensure the right trade goes to the right job. We also aim to ensure better management of the supply chain to ensure there is a focus on getting repairs right first time.</p>
	<p pid="f.27W.5/3">All SFA locations are to be assigned to a specified DE Housing Officer and MHS Technical Officer who will work closely to provide a cohesive approach to enhanced service delivery. They will act as dedicated focal points for local commanders and will be responsible for holding housing clinics, getting to know families and resolving everyday problems.</p>

	<p pid="f.27W.8/1">The majority of mental healthcare for service personnel is provided through MOD's 15 military-run Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs) in the UK (with additional centres in Germany, Cyprus and Gibraltar), which have since 2004 provided out-patient mental healthcare for members of the armed forces. Responsibility for their individual management is shared between the single service commands, with oversight from the Joint Medical Command. However, each service funds its respective DCMHs differently. Owing to the number of different internal budgets to which costs would be attributable, any detailed analysis of DCMH finances would therefore incur disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="f.27W.8/2">In-patient care, when necessary, is provided in specialised psychiatric units under contract with an external provider. Between April 2004 and March 2009, this was provided by the Priory Group, and costs in each financial year are contained in the following table:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="f.27W.8/14">These figures take into account the cost of assessing patients as well as any treatment programmes provided; the individual care needs of each patient will vary depending on their particular medical circumstances.

	<p pid="f.27W.8/15">The contract with the Priory Group has been replaced by a new one, awarded in November 2008 following open competition, with a partnership of seven NHS trusts led by South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Foundation Trust. Costs for its first full 12 months of operation will be available in spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="f.27W.8/16">Prior to April 2004, in-patient care was provided at MOD's Duchess of Kent Psychiatric Hospital at Catterick. Full historic costs back to 2001 are not available, although costs in its final year of operation (2002-03) were some &#163;10 million.</p>

	<p pid="f.42W.5/2">Like all Government Departments, the Ministry of Defence routinely reviews expenditure to ensure that we allocate our resources where they are needed most. As part of this process senior officials discussed emerging budgetary pressures in the summer and then asked all budget holders within the Department to review all uncommitted funding. Following this review, savings measures that helped balance the financial deficit, and which do not detract from support to current operations, were recommended. Although some of these savings are painful, they had to be taken to ensure that the Ministry of Defence stayed within budget.</p>

	<p pid="f.43W.5/1">The arrangements to ensure the fairness of the tendering process in circumstances where CEFAS is both involved in advising on the selection of bids and is itself one of the bidders is set out the governance document 'Marine Environment Protection Fund (MEPF): Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund Delivery Partner on behalf of DEFRA: Who We Are and How We Operate' published on the MALSF website at</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.alsf-mepf.org.uk/downloads/documents/mepf---how-we-operate.asp">http://www.alsf-mepf.org.uk/downloads/documents/mepf---how-we-operate.asp</a>x</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/3">The Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund is delivered through the Marine Environment Protection Fund (MEPF) which is administered by CEFAS on behalf of DEFRA and reports to DEFRA though the Marine ALSF Steering Group. The Marine ALSF Steering Group oversees the direction of the fund, develops the commissioning strategy for research and dissemination activities and oversees delivery arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/4">All funding decisions are made by the MEPF evaluation panel which undertakes the evaluation of tenders. The MEPF evaluation panel is chaired by DEFRA and comprises representation from eight organisations of which CEFAS is one, plus the Marine ALSF Science Co-ordinator who is appointed through an open competition. The MEPF provides the Secretariat function to the evaluation panel and any views and opinions of the Secretariat at the evaluation panel meetings are made as representing the MEPF as a delivery partner. The Secretariat has no decision-making powers or voting rights on the evaluation panel.</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/5">The MEPF panel's terms of reference govern the arrangements for ensuring fairness in the evaluation of bids in circumstances where an evaluation panel member is from the same organisation as a bidder. These arrangements involve:</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/6" class="indent">1. All evaluation panels begin with a round-table declaration of any potential conflicts of interest. A two-tiered approach to managing potential conflicts is then followed:</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/7" class="indent">a) Direct involvement-If a panel member is to be part of a project delivery team and/or has helped prepare the proposal, they are required to be absent from the room while the proposal is being discussed and evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/8" class="indent">b) Indirect involvement-If a panel member's company/organisation has submitted a proposal but the panel member had played no part whatsoever in its preparation nor was to be involved with the project delivery team, the panel member is required to be a non-voting member of the panel while considering the bid but may remain in the room while the proposal is being discussed and evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/9" class="indent">2. Any individual involved in project evaluation other than central Government staff members will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement to protect the intellectual property of project applicants. These agreements must also be in place for any member of staff who receives bids from the other distributing bodies during the liaison process.</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/10">To maintain impartiality and confidentiality, the MEPF delivery partner operates entirely separately from CEFAS' main corporate and delivery functions. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/11" class="indent">MEPF services are provided by a dedicated team from the Programme Management Group of CEFAS devoted only to the provision of MEPF fund management services.</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/12" class="indent">The MEPF is separate from the Science Delivery Divisions and the Commercial Group of CEFAS and MEPF staff are not involved in MEPF bid preparation or delivery.</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/13" class="indent">CEFAS bidding teams and project leaders are not able to have sight of MEPF Managed Funds papers.</p>
	<p pid="f.43W.5/14" class="indent">Electronic files are stored on local area, not shared contracts area, with restricted access to the ALSF_MEPF local areas. Paper files are locked away and stored separately away from central contracts file store.</p>

	<p pid="f.56W.2/1">The Government's policy on tackling litter applies to all communities. There is no excuse for littering and local authorities have been given powers to deal with litterers, most recently through the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. Littering is an offence and if convicted in a magistrates court an offender may receive a fine of up to &#163;2,500 and a criminal record. As an alternative, local authorities have powers to issue on the spot fines of up to &#163;80. The 2005 Act includes a power for parish councils to issue on the spot fines for littering the first time.</p>
	<p pid="f.56W.2/2">Through its annual grant to the charity Keep Britain Tidy, the Government campaign for behaviour change on litter. Campaigns like The Big Tidy Up and the Eco-Schools programme raise awareness of the issue, and get communities and individuals actively involved in clean-ups, in understanding the impact of littering and taking greater responsibility for their neighbourhoods.</p>

	<p pid="f.56W.8/1">No formal assessment has been made. However, at the time when the ban was introduced in 2001, around 70 swill processors lost trade and around 90 swill feeders had to find alternative sources of feed. Restaurants, kitchens and factories producing food also had to find alternative disposal routes. These bodies have subsequently adapted to the new rules and so a cost comparison between then and now would be difficult to make.</p>
	<p pid="f.56W.8/2">The benefits of maintaining the ban remain primarily the prevention of disease spread. As the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak demonstrated, the financial and practical consequences of one mistake in swill feeding can be enormous and potentially far outweigh the costs above. This FMD outbreak, the cause of which was thought to be the feeding of unprocessed swill to pigs, is estimated to have cost in the region of &#163;8 billion (including indirect costs) and the potential for re-introducing the disease by livestock being illegally fed on infected meat is a constant and on-going concern. For this reason, the Government support a maintenance of the EU wide ban which is now in place.</p>

There are no current plans to introduce compulsory farm of origin labelling for lamb, or for other meats. Government do however support current EU proposals for a Regulation on the Provision of Food Information which would tighten up country or origin labelling, particularly for meat and meat products, requiring specified information to be given where claims of origin are made.

The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) event on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-23">23 September</phrase> highlighted the importance of providing health services free at the point of delivery. The UK-initiated Global Consensus on Maternal, Newborn and Child Health was also widely endorsed. It seeks to make health systems and investments work better for women and children, thus driving up standards. Leaders from Nepal, Malawi, Ghana, Liberia, Burundi and Sierra Leone announced historic shifts towards free health care. Removing the financial barriers to health services and providing services free at the point of use for women and children will ensure that the poorest people, especially women and girls, can access a trained health worker in the right place at the right time with the right infrastructure, equipment and drugs.</p>

	<p pid="f.65W.2/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) support to India's National Tuberculosis Control Programme has been highly effective. The programme has averted an estimated 180,000 deaths a year since 2005. That is around 500 lives saved in India every day.

	<p pid="f.79W.10/2"><i> </i>Research reported in the IPCC's fourth assessment report suggest a small, but significant, total warming effect since 1750 from Black Carbon emitted into the atmosphere by fossil fuel (the main source), biofuel and biomass burning. This effect is estimated to be the equivalent of about one seventh of the total climate warming effect from long lived greenhouse gases. There is also an additional but smaller warming effect due to the deposition of Black Carbon on surface snow and ice. Recent work by the Met Office Hadley Centre, funded by DECC, suggests Black Carbon emissions have potentially the second largest warming influence on climate, after greenhouse gases.</p>
	<p pid="f.79W.10/3">The Air Quality and Climate Change: A UK Perspective, 2007 report by the Air Quality Expert Group considered the effects of air pollutants on air quality and climate change. Improvements in air quality will have a complex influence on climate change, as some pollutants have a direct or indirect warming effect while aerosol emissions other than Black Carbon have a cooling effect.</p>

These core SWL categories were identified as being those that tend to be most interlinked when addressing clients' SWL problems. For example, a client facing eviction from a private landlord may also be experiencing debt and welfare benefits problems. In order to provide an efficient and effective service for this client, it is important that the provider from whom the client seeks advice is able to offer assistance across the range of problems that the client is experiencing.</p>

We anticipate appointing up to seven firms onto the framework in spring next year with the first prison being operational in 2013. Under the design, build and operate contracts NOMS will not pay a capital cost for construction and operation, and will instead be charged a single revenue stream covering these elements for the full period of the PFI contracts. It is therefore not possible to identify the capital cost of construction. However, we estimate the total cost of the five new prisons to be in the region of &#163;1.2 billion (at 2008-09 prices and excluding VAT and site purchase costs).</p>

	<p pid="f.108W.2/1">Lord Bradley made 82 recommendations, many of which Lord Bradley himself recognised needed further work to ensure that all implications are considered for children, young people and adults. The Government have accepted the direction set out in the report and has committed to report to Parliament on the progress made by the end of October.</p>
	<p pid="f.108W.2/2">A Health and Criminal Justice National Programme Board has been fully operational since June 2009 bringing together senior officials in the key Departments (Department of Health, Ministry of Justice, Home Office, Department for Children, Schools and Families). The Programme Board has been meeting monthly to pull together a national delivery plan and ensure appropriate cross-government representation and engagement as actions are being developed.</p>
	<p pid="f.108W.2/3">The first objective of the Programme Board has been to develop a national delivery plan that will set out our shared vision for improving health and social care services for all those in touch with the criminal justice system including reviewing arrangements for reception for those entering prison. The newly established Health and Criminal Justice Programme Board have been working hard to ensure that all the Bradley recommendations are fully incorporated into this cross-government plan.</p>
	<p pid="f.108W.2/4">Ministers are due to report to parliament by the end of this month on progress in this regard.</p>

Only the last 60 months data are available; therefore data prior to September 2004 are not available. September to December data are available for 2004. March to August data are available for 2009-10.<br/>  2. NHS Prescription Services (RxS) is responsible for the reimbursement and remuneration of dispensing contractors in England on behalf of the Department of Health. NHS RxS captures prescription items submitted by dispensing contractors for reimbursement and remuneration purposes.<br/>  3. North Yorkshire and York has been defined as the North Yorkshire and York Primary Care Trust (PCT).<br/>  4. On 1 October 2006 four PCTs, Hambelton and Richmondshire PCT, Craven Harrogate and Rural District PCT, Scarborough, Whitby and Rydale PCT and Selby and York PCT merged to form North Yorkshire and York PCT. The data provided prior to October 2006 have been collated from these PCTs and have been structured in line with current PCT arrangements.<br/>  5. The data are based on England community dispensing (not prescribing) data only. These may include items prescribed in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man which have been dispensed in England. The data exclude items prescribed in England but dispensed in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Isle of Man.<br/>  6. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in prisons, hospitals, including mental health trusts, walk-in centres or private prescriptions but do include prison and hospital prescriptions which are dispensed in the community.<br/>  7. Prescriptions are written/printed on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<br/>  8. The net ingredient cost is the basic price of a drug prior to discount being deducted (where applicable) as stated in Part II Clause 8 of the Drug Tariff for England and Wales (www.ppa.org.uk/ppa/edt_intro.htm). It excludes dispensing fees, container allowances and other fees paid to contractors.<br/>  9. The average net ingredient cost per item for North Yorkshire and York Primary Care Trust has fallen significantly between September 2004 and August 2009. This follows the downward trend in the national average net ingredient cost over the same period. <i> Prescription exemption data.</i><br/>  10. When determining payment to contractors, it is only necessary for NHS RxS to determine whether:<br/>  a prescription charge has been collected; or<br/>  a patient has completed a declaration of exemption, when a declaration is required.<br/>  Up until November 2007, NHS RxS determined and recorded the exemption category on every 20th form that is exempt from the prescription charge. The data were recorded from the tick-box shown on the reverse of FP10 prescription forms, and where appropriate from the age or date of birth printed on the front of the form. This relied on the form to be clear and completed correctly which may not have always been the case.<br/>  11. The information from the sample of prescription forms informed the Department of Health of the frequency of claims for exemption from prescription charges in each exemption category.<br/>  12. Due to the method applied when sampling exemption data, this information can only be viewed as an estimate of the number of products issued for patients within an exemption category and is not statistically valid when applied to individual PCT's.<br/>  13. From December 2007 NHS RxS changed the processes for pricing prescriptions and for capturing prescription charge exemption status. Therefore NHS RxS cannot reliably estimate the data for each exemption category relating to the age of the patient from this date.<br/>  14. The processes for capturing information during the reimbursement and remuneration processes undertaken formerly by the Prescription Pricing Authority, and latterly by NHS RxS, were designed to allow an analysis of trends in prescribing and dispensing patterns. However, tighter statistical governance requirements and greater scrutiny of the level of accuracy and precision of data within the NHS suggest that it would be inappropriate to provide exemption category data in detail.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  National Health Service RxS Information System.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="f.116W.0/1">The vast majority of printers in use on the BIS estate are provided by our IT supplier as part of overall desktop services and the main infrastructure contract covering this provision has been in place for 10 years. Many of the printers supplied to the Department will be 'user configurable', as is the choice of which particular printer to use.</p>
	<p pid="f.116W.0/2">The Department is very conscious of the fact that the 'cost of print' offers many opportunities for efficiencies, both in the level of paper used and the corresponding cost of toners used. Aside from cost, there are also carbon footprint issues that can be addressed and the Department is fully committed to seeking efficiencies in both. As such, we already have a commitment to make more efficient use of printers. Staff are encouraged to use the double-sided printing option wherever possible and not to use colour printers as their default printer when colour is not required. Similarly, we encourage all staff to make better use of the Department's internal reprographics services where this is appropriate to ensure that both printing and copying are undertaken in the most efficient way.</p>
	<p pid="f.116W.0/3">Going forward, the Department will be looking at options to audit our overall cost of print, ways in which printers are deployed across the estate, and the types that are used, so that we are better able to mandate particular usage.</p>

	<p pid="f.126W.2/1">BIS and its predecessors have worked with other Government Departments, the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) and other organisations to support research and development (R&amp;D) by the UK automotive sector in a range of ways over the last five years. In particular, the Technology Strategy Board's Low Carbon Vehicles Innovation Platform, launched in May 2007, is the key delivery agent for the Government's R&amp;D funding on low carbon vehicles. The Low Carbon Vehicles Integrated Delivery Programme is a key tool that the Innovation Platform will use to achieve its goal over the coming five years. The programme involves about &#163;250 million of joint government and industry investment and co-ordinates the UK's low carbon vehicle activity from initial strategic academic research through to industry-led collaborative R&amp;D. &#163;25 million has been allocated to highly innovative, industry-led collaborative research projects in the field of ultra low carbon vehicle development and demonstration.</p>
	<p pid="f.126W.2/2">Government have also supported automotive R&amp;D through the Centres of Excellence on Low Carbon and Fuel Cells (CENEX) and Intelligent Transport Systems and Sustainable Mobility (InnovITS) which have received total funding from this Department of over &#163;13 million. The Foresight Vehicle programme ran from 1997 to 2007 and supported R&amp;D through the associated LINK programme.</p>
	<p pid="f.126W.2/3">Government provided over &#163;45 million funding which supported 100 collaborative R&amp;D projects with a value in excess of &#163;100 million. In addition, the &#163;2.3 billion Automotive Assistance Programme has been designed, among other things, to help support the development of cutting-edge technology in the longer term.</p>

	<p pid="f.132W.3/1">In general, we believe it is right to give priority in spending public funds on students studying a degree for the first time. This has for some time been our policy on financial support for students, and it has increasingly been our policy in respect of the teaching grant paid to universities since 2008. We believe it to be the right policy on grounds of equity because it allows more people access to higher education; and because it is the most effective way to grow the number of people with high levels skills. There are exceptions to this general presumption: for example, students going to study at a higher level, and students studying programmes which most clearly meet economic needs such as foundation degree programmes.</p>

	<p pid="f.143W.2/1">Total Place is an ambitious initiative that will consider how a 'whole area' approach to public services can lead to better services at less cost through 13 pilot areas covering 63 councils from across England.</p>
	<p pid="f.143W.2/2">This work forms part of the Operational Efficiency programme (OEP) strand led by Sir Michael Bichard which seeks to create the environment where collaboration and innovation on the frontline leads to reduced costs and new ways of working.</p>
	<p pid="f.143W.2/3">Each of the pilots have picked at least one particular theme to explore in detail how delivery partners in the pilot area will work together, to identify innovative ways to deliver better, customer-led services for less. It will help them to bring together the evidence on the needs of their customers, and on what is being spent, by which agencies, and on what services, to address those needs.</p>

	<p pid="f.146W.2/1">The rateable value thresholds in the Small Business Rate Relief scheme will increase from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>. Eligible businesses, who generally occupy only one property, with a rateable value of &#163;6,000 or below (increased from &#163;5,000) may apply for 50 per cent. relief. Eligible ratepayers with a rateable value between &#163;6,001 and &#163;12,000 (increased from &#163;5,001 and &#163;10,000 respectively) may apply for relief on a sliding scale between 50 and 0 per cent..

Additional properties with a rateable value up to &#163;2,599 (increased from &#163;2,199) can be disregarded in deciding whether the single occupancy criterion has been met. However, the rateable values of such properties are included in determining whether or not the threshold criterion has been met.</p>

Hereditaments with a rateable value of &#163;50,000 or less will be exempt from the business rate supplements. In addition there is discretion within the Business Rate Supplements Act 2009 for levying authorities to increase the liability threshold.</p>

	<p pid="f.147W.8/2">The Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 provides for places of meeting for religious worship to be certified to the Registrar General but does not apply to the established Church. When considering the registration of a building which has been certified as a place of religious worship, the Registrar General applies the judgment by the Court of Appeal in the Segerdal case. The main finding in the judgment is that the words 'place of meeting for religious worship' in the Act connote a place of which the principal use is for people to come together as a congregation to worship God or do reverence to a deity. Apart from the Church of England and the Church in Wales, any faith or denomination which meets these criteria would be capable of recognition under the 1855 Act.</p>

We have improved the wording, lay-out and design of the form. The questionnaire used for the previous assessment did not fully take into account the cognitive functions of people with learning disabilities and other conditions such as brain damage, that are not mental health problems. The new questionnaire also includes the opportunity for individuals to detail fluctuations in the nature of their condition. Where customers suffer from mental health conditions, the claim will be progressed even if the questionnaire is not completed.</p>
	<p pid="f.158W.11/3">Every month a customer satisfaction survey is sent at random to a large number of customers. This ensures an ongoing assessment of the customer experience and highlights any areas in need of review and improvement.</p>
	<p pid="f.158W.11/4">In addition, to protect our most vulnerable customers, Jobcentre Plus has ensured that safeguards are embedded into the design and delivery of employment and support allowance. These safeguards ensure that where a customer has a mental health condition, and fails to comply with the Work Capability Assessment processes, benefit will not be withdrawn until their responsibilities have been explained to them either by telephone contact or a home visit.</p>

Local agencies using Anti-social behaviour Orders (ASBOs) find them cost effective. The cost of not taking action is much higher.</p>
	<p pid="f.173W.2/2">Since ASBOs were introduced in 1998 there have been real changes in how people feel about anti-social behaviour: 17 per cent. of people felt that levels of ASB in their areas were high in 2008-09 compared to 21 per cent. in 2002-03. The tools and powers introduced by this Government over the last 11 years are working: the 2006 NAO report on anti-social behaviour found that 93 per cent. of people desisted from ASB after the third intervention.</p>

	<p pid="f.176W.11/3">The number of subject profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. A proportion of DNA profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded on more then one occasion (this may be because the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because of upgrading of profiles). It is currently estimated that 13.8 per cent. of profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. The replication rate of 13.8 per cent. should only be applied over the entire database however, as the replication rate for individual police forces varies considerably. The presence of these replicate profiles on the NDNAD does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database.</p>

	<p pid="f.178W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="f.178W.2/2">Our regular meetings with the RSPCA include reviewing dog fighting issues, which has long been an illegal activity. It is premature to speculate on the basis of the available evidence whether there have been any significant trends in the prevalence of dog fighting.</p>
	<p pid="f.178W.2/3">However, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 updated and strengthened the law on animal fighting. The Act created separate offences for animal fighting and significantly increased the maximum financial penalties available to the courts for such offences. Anyone found guilty of an offence related to animal fighting is liable to a maximum fine of &#163;20,000 (previously &#163;5,000), or six months' imprisonment, or both.</p>
	<p pid="f.178W.2/4">We have also recently published new guidance for the police on the enforcement of dangerous dogs law as well as provided the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) with &#163;20,000 to assist in the training of police officers in the use of dangerous dogs law. The guidance and training includes the identification of illegal pit bull type dogs that are commonly used in dog fighting.</p>
	<p pid="f.178W.2/5">The Home Office are legislating (in the Policing and Crime Bill) to create a new power to prevent gang-related violence. This will enable police or local authorities to ask the courts to prohibit gang members from doing a number of things, including being in charge of an animal in a public place.</p>

	<p pid="f.185W.9/4">The public panel will meet in six groups across the UK. The first two groups for the north and south of England have just been set up, following a campaign seeking people to join the panel.</p>
	<p pid="f.185W.9/5">For these two groups we received 113 applications. Applicants were asked their background: 12 categories were used such as employed, unemployed, in training, education, carer, and applicants were also asked about their knowledge or views of the NIS (making clear no view or knowledge was necessary for the role). The background categories were then used to randomly select members to proceed to an informal discussion with Identity and Passport Service (IPS) officials. Candidates for Chair had a short interview with an IPS official and an independent assessor.</p>
	<p pid="f.185W.9/6">Information for applicants was approved by Plain English and is available in Braille, large print format, Easyread format, and audio. This information will be used for all six groups and cost &#163;6,600. Advertisement costs in local and regional newspapers for the north and south groups cost &#163;8,800.</p>
	<p pid="f.185W.9/7">The estimated cost of information and publicity to set up all six regional groups is &#163;60,000. Administrative support for the panel will be provided by IPS; the estimated cost of running the public panel in the current financial year is &#163;16,000, which allows for reimbursement of expenses to panel members.</p>

The Home Office, with a contribution from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, met the start-up costs of $1,803,580 US. The scheme is now self-financing, applicants paying a fee of between $50 and $77 US (up to &#163;50).

	<p pid="f.199W.2/1">During any major refurbishment project, the Department expects those responsible, to remove hazardous asbestos and asbestos likely to be disturbed. Outside major projects, periodic asbestos surveys identify Asbestos Containing Materials that are likely to deteriorate and we expect them to be removed or encapsulated.</p>
	<p pid="f.199W.2/2">There is no requirement for routine reports of the condition of asbestos containing materials; for each public building there is an individual with specific statutory duties related to asbestos but routine reporting is not one of those duties. So, data is not available on the number of schools found to contain hazardous asbestos in the last 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="f.206W.2/1">Reducing the number of young people misusing drugs or alcohol is one of the Government's national priorities and progress is measured through National Indicator 115 and through delivery of the commitments set out in the National Drug Strategy (2008).</p>
	<p pid="f.206W.2/2">Drug use among young people (11-15) has fallen significantly from 20 per cent. in 2001 to 15 per cent. in 2008. Drug use among 16 to 25-year-olds has also decreased significantly from 29.7 per cent. in 1996 to 22.6 per cent. in 2008/09. At the same time as these falls, there are a record number of treatment places available for those young people (under 18) who need them.</p>
