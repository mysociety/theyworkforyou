   Members of the Scottish Parliament from 1999 to
   the present day, which is 2007-12-12.

       id:
             values arbitrarily starting at 80000.  (These
             should be stable now.)

       todate, towhy, fromdate, fromwhy:

             These are roughly the same as in ni-members.xml and
             all-members.xml, so fromwhy and towhy include
             "by_election", "changed_party", "resigned" and
             "still_in_office".  Extra "why" values include:

             - "regional_election" instead of "general_election"

             - "became_presiding_officer" (probably worth
               distinguishing from a change of party, although
               that implies a change of party to "None" (No
               party affiliation).

             - "replaced_in_region": if an MSP resigns and they
               have a regional seat, they're replaced from the
               party's top-up list rather than having a
               by-election.

             todate typically goes up to the day before the
             election and fromdate typically starts on the day
             of the election.  So, while there are many possible
             values because people can resign, etc. at any time,
             mostly they are one of:

                fromdate:
                             1999-05-06  (start of session 1)
                             2003-05-01  (start of session 2)
                             2007-05-03  (start of session 3)

                todate:
                             2003-04-30  (dissolution end of session 1) 2003-03-31
                             2007-05-02  (dissolution of session 2) 2007-04-02
                             9999-12-31

       webcategory:

             The SP website divides MSPs into "current" (meaning
             what you'd expect) and "historic" from all of the
             sessions including the current one.  (This field
             probably isn't generally useful except in the
             scraping.)  MPs become "historic" as soon as they
             resign so there may be some historic members for
             the current session.

       spurl:

             The URL of that MSP's page on the SP website.  MSPs
             have separate web pages for session 1 and 2 of the
             parliament.

       firstname:

              Just the first name of the MSP.  It's not clear to
              me what the rest of theyworkforyou does about
              middle names, but there are only two tricky cases
              here "John Home Robertson" and "John Farquhar
              Munro".  I've made the lastnames "Home Robertson"
              and "Farquhar Munro", since the former was a past
              MP and that's what all-members.xml does.  There's
              one double-barreled first name (Dorothy-Grace
              Elder).

       lastname:

              Just the last (possibly double-barreled) name of
              the MSP.

       title:

             If the SP web pages for that MSP give a title,
             that's here, otherwise it's empty.

       suffix:

             The SP web pages for current MSPs include the
             suffix MSP, but there are also QCs, OBEs, etc.
             If these suffices are specified on the web page,
             I've included that here.

       haveimage:

             I've scraped the pictures of the current MSPs, this
             is "true" if I've currently got one.  (This may be
             innaccurate at the moment - you'll need to check
             whether it's actually in msp-images.

      imagesource:

             Just empty or "from_sp_website" at the moment,
             although I put this in in case someone wants to
             acquire images from public domain sources of one
             kind or another.  (In fact, I've added
             "from_wikipedia" for Sir David Steel.)

       constituency:

             The name of the region or constituency; the name
             determines whether this is a regional or
             constituency seat, so the next field is actually
             redundant.

       membertype:

             Either "constituency" or "region".

       party:

             The full name of that MSP's political party
             afilliation (if any).  Currently this is one of:

               "Con"         (Conservative)
               "Green"
               "Independent"
               "Lab"         (Labour)
               "LDem"        (Liberal Democrat)
               "None"        (No party affiliation, for the
                              Presiding Officer)
               "SNP"         (Scottish National Party)
               "SSCUP"       (Scottish Senior Citizens’ Unity Party)
               "SSP"         (Scottish Socialist Party)
               "SG"          (Solidarity Group)
