In the last few weeks, you tried to create an alert on TheyWorkForYou.
We've just found and fixed a bug that meant confirmation emails weren't
being sent out, which means you could never confirm your alert. We're
very sorry about that, and so are resending your confirmation link so
you can confirm your alert (obviously, if you've changed your mind and
don't want an alert any more, just ignore this email).

${out}Again, apologies for the confusion. If you have any questions,
please just reply to this email.

Yours,
Matthew, TheyWorkForYou
