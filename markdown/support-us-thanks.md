# Thank you for supporting TheyWorkForYou and mySociety

Working with people across the country, we can make how British politics works more understandable and transparent, and empower people working to make better decisions. We want to be a lever, that we operate on behalf of our fellow citizens, to shift how politics works.

Your support is about helping us rise to meet the challenges we face, to make TheyWorkForYou and our other services equal to the challenges of the next twenty years.

Weâ€™ll [put your donation to good use](/support-us/#why-does-mysociety-need-donations-for-these-sites)- thank you for your help.
