# The polls are closed!

The UK general election is now over.

Through Thursday night and into Friday, the votes will be counted, winners announced - and we will be loading the new MPs into TheyWorkForYou. 

We've prepared a [few blog posts and resources](https://www.mysociety.org/?p=54263) to understand the new Parliament - you can read these [on our blog](https://www.mysociety.org/?p=54263).

### Support TheyWorkForYou's work in the coming Parliament

TheyWorkForYou and WriteToThem are run by [mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/), a small UK charity. 

We're a very efficient operation and do a lot with a small team: at the moment TheyWorkForYou, which is used by millions of people every year, is run with the equivalent of about two people.

If we had [a *bit* more money, we could achieve a *lot* more]((/support-us/)).

We want to see a transparent, resilient democracy, with equal access to information, representation and voice for citizens.

If you believe in this vision [please donate today](/support-us/) to enable greater transparency and accountability of the next government.
