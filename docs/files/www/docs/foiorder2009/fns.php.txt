<p>On the 16th of May 2008 the High Court ruled that MPs&rsquo; expenses must be published under the Freedom of Information Act.

<p>Last Thursday, MPs were going to vote on changing the law to keep their expenses secret after all,
just before publication was due and after spending nearly a million of your pounds and seven months
compiling the data.

<p>However, after a <strong>tremendous response</strong> from you, with over 7,000 members
on our Facebook group, 4,000 messages sent to MPs, help from
<a href="http://twitter.com/stephenfry/statuses/1136046150">Stephen Fry</a>, and a helpful
<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldmerit/16/1603.htm">4th Report of the House of Lords
Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee</a>,
it appears that the vote has been cancelled &ndash;

<p>As President Obama said in his inauguration speech: <em>&ldquo;And
those of us who manage the public&rsquo;s dollars will be held to account &ndash; to
spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day &ndash;
because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their
government.&rdquo;</em></p>
