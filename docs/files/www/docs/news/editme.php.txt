In order to monitor the service for abuse, help with support and maintenance,
locate large volume/ commercial users to ask them to contribute to our costs,
and provide users with usage statistics of their application, we're adding API
keys to our <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/">API</a>. Apologies to
current API users who will be inconvenienced; the API will allow key-less calls
for a short time, during which current users can get a key and update their
code.

In front end news, we now locate whenever an old version of Hansard is
referenced (which they do by date and column number, e.g. <a

Report</i>, 29 February 2008, column 1425</a>) and turn the citation into a
link to a search for the speeches in that column on that date. This only really
became feasible when we moved server, upgraded <a
href="http://www.xapian.org/">Xapian</a>, and added date and column number
metadata (among others), allowing much more advanced and focussed searching -
the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/">advanced search form</a>
gives some other ideas. Perhaps in future we'll be able to add some
crowd-sourcing game to match the reference to the exact speech, much like our

<p>You can start matching up speeches with video snippets right away, but if you take 30 seconds to <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/user/?pg=join&#038;ret=/video/">register a username</a> then we&#8217;ll log every speech that you match up and recognise your contribution on our <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/video/">&#8220;top timestampers&#8221; league table</a>.

its own main tab, with links to the sections and representatives under each one

We've added MPs' membership of select committees, taken from

Our rankings for various numbers have been removed, to be replaced by
woolly text &ndash; we have <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/help/#numbers">more
information on this</a>. To make up for it, we've done a bit more text
analysis, and added which departments and subjects an MP asks most
written questions about, so you can see that
<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/alan_williams/swansea_west">Alan Williams</a>
has asked more questions about Royal Residences than anything else, or that
<a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/anne_main/st_albans">Anne Main</a> has asked
more questions on Flag Flying.

Firefox users can download a
<a href="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=theyworkforyou">search plugin</a>,
to enable easy searching of the site from Firefox's search bar.

And a few bugfixes - our handling of when Oral Answers finish should be a bit better than previously,
and when searching a particular person's speeches, we no longer group the results by debate, which
was confusing, as you obviously expected to see all the speeches for that person that matched your
search terms.

RSS is a simple way to publish & distribute content which is frequently updated  (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3223484.stm">learn more here</a>.)

Some enlightened MPs are now incorporating this useful feed of their Parliamentary activity into their websites. See <a href="http://www.richardallan.org.uk/">Richard Allen's</a> website for a good example.

16 => array("NEW! MPs' Expenses", <<<EOT
At the bottom of <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mps/">each MP's page</a>, you can now see how much money your MP has claimed in allowances over the past three years.

For example, it is good to note that <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?pid=10508#expenses">Barbara Roche</a>, a North London MP, does not claim excessive travel expenses.

Bear in mind that proper democracy does cost money, so please think twice before using these data as a stick with which to beat your MP. An "expensive" MP might be providing excellent value for money. And vice versa.

Shortly after we launched our beta test in June we decided we should also open up access to the wiki we use to help develop TheyWorkForYou.com so that anyone can also have a go, muck in, or just laugh at us.

Of course, that took far longer than we planned, but having <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/news/archives/2004/07/18/new_full_source_.php">published the source code</a>, we should open up the wiki too.

We don't like wiki spam, so it will remain passworded, but anyone who wants a browse can tuck in at the <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wiki/moin.cgi">TheyWorkForYou.com wiki</a>

In case you're wondering what we're up to, well, we're just rousing ourselves for another tilt at completing our vision before the next election is called, so if anyone python or php skills and fancies lending a hand, do <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.

<strong>Update:</strong> Code has moved location, updated the URLs and text accordingly.

We're <em>really</em> keen for others to use both our code and the data feeds we make available to make the UK's Parliament more accessible.

Most notably, we've published the source code for the front and back end of TheyWorkForYou.com. It's available here:
<a href="https://secure.mysociety.org/cvstrac/dir?d=mysociety/twfy">https://secure.mysociety.org/cvstrac/dir?d=mysociety/twfy</a> for the front end website, and
<a href="http://www.knowledgeforge.net/project/ukparse/">http://www.knowledgeforge.net/project/ukparse/</a> for the backend scraper and parser.

<strong>But there's more!</strong> Below, you'll find links to various other open data feeds and resources we've produced to date:

<a href="http://ukparse.kforge.net/parlparse/">http://ukparse.kforge.net/parlparse/</a> - XML files of debates / written answers back to June 2001 (House of Commons only - not Westminster Hall); MP id and constituency index files;  how to use the parser source code.

<a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/project/data.php">http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/project/data.php</a> - MP performance data; voting record matrices.

Welcome to the public beta of TheyWorkForYou.com, which launched on Sunday 6th June 2004 at the <a href="http://www.notcon04.com/" title="link to NotCon04 conference website">NotCon04</a> conference.

We hope you enjoy using the service during its public beta phase, which will last for  a while as we unpick all the bugs and tweak the features.

We want to know everything: what you like, what you hate, what works, what's broken, what could we do better. The lot. Don't hold back.

The search engine is our main area of immediate focus - we know we've got months of tuning and tweaking of search results to come. We know enough to know that great search is hard, and that your feedback is crucial.

In the meantime, please enjoy being the first people to scribble in the margins of Hansard. May you be first of many.

<a href="/contact/">Send all bug reports (and feature suggestions) to us</a>.

Finally, a big 'thank you' to everyone who helped test the site during the private beta phase over the past two weeks. Your feedback has been invaluable.

More than the usuals,

Please remember that this isn't yet a complete record of our MPs' activities in the House of Commons. For that we need to add the transcripts of Select Committee proceedings and a load of other fiddly and esoteric information.

We also want to add data from before 2001. And there's always the Lords... We yearn to be a complete record.

But to do this, we will need to ensure our key developers are kept fed. If you're in a sugar daddy frame of mind, we'd be only too pleased to accept donations.

Just <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.

Hello all, and thank you for helping to road test TheyWorkForYou.com. We hope you enjoy our new baby; we're proud of her, even though she's still somewhat rough around the edges.

We've just entered our 'closed beta' phase - you'll need a password to access the site until we move into our open beta phase sometime in June.

Please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> with your feedback, or you can just add your comments to this blog.

The venerable <i>Times</i> is grumpy. In a <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-2060278,00.html">feature article</a> by the tabloid's <a href="http://www.explore.parliament.uk/Parliament.aspx?id=10305&glossary=true">lobby correspondent</a> Greg Hurst, the paper claims that some new MPs are asking frivolous written questions with the sole intention of improving their statistics on TheyWorkForYou.com.

Here at TheyWorkForYou.com we are honoured to be featured so prominently in such a venerable organ as <i>The Times</i>.

And we share a concern that overly crude measurement can distort behaviours. But the volunteers who run this site favour transparent hard data over lobby gossip, anecdote and anonymous parliamentary sources. So we examined the volume of Written Questios

The Times also puiblished a typically despairing leader on the same subject, bemoaning the demise of parliamentary oratory and describing TheyWorkForYou as 'intimidatingly named'.
