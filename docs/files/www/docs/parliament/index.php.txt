<p>In the UK, Parliament consists of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, with the monarch at the head.</p>

<p> The House of Commons is made up of democratically elected <a href='/mps/'>Members of Parliament (MPs)</a> representing every UK constituency. The <a href='/peers/'>House of Lords</a> is composed of unelected peers and senior bishops. Proceedings are overseen by a Speaker, whose job it is to retain order.</p>

<p>Parliament meets at the Houses of Westminster in London. Here there is a regular schedule of events, including <a href='/debates/'>debates</a>, <a href='/pbc/'>committees</a> and <a href='/written-answers-and-statements/'>parliamentary questions</a>. If you would like to learn more about what exactly goes on in Parliament, visit our <a href='/'>homepage</a>, where you can find out who your MP is, see recent debates and statements, and set up email alerts.</p>
