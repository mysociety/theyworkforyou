<section id="introduction">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The TheyWorkForYou API (“API”, the “Service”) is operated by SocietyWorks Ltd, company
no. 5798215, of 483 Green Lanes, London N13 4BS (“we” or “us”).</p>
<p>By using the Service or signing up for an account, you’re agreeing to these Terms,
which form a legally binding agreement. Please read them carefully - they
define the conditions under which you’re allowed to use the Service.</p>
<P>In order to use the Service, you must be at least 18 years old and legally able to
enter into contracts. If you use the Service on behalf of a company or organisation
you warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on behalf of that
company or organisation.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to update and change these Terms from time to
time without notice and at our sole discretion.</p>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to block, without warning, usage which violates any
of the following restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="call-limits">Call limits</h3>
<p>The ‘call limit’ is the number of calls which can be made to the API in any
one month.</p>
<p>Without subscribing to a plan, you may call the API 10 times per day.</p>
<p>Call limits are described on our <a href="/api/">main API
page</a>. When creating an account you can pick the most appropriate plan for
your needs. In any one month, if you reach the call limit associated with your
current plan, you will have to cease your usage until the next month, or
upgrade to the next pricing level.</p>
<h3 id="charitable-use">Charitable use</h3>
<p>Low-volume charitable use of the TheyWorkForYou API is free. This means direct use by
registered charities (not paid contractors working on behalf of a charity) or
by individuals pursuing a non-profit project on an unpaid basis, with a volume
of up to 1,000 calls per month. Higher volume charitable users get a 50%
discount off our standard pricing.</p>
<p>You can request charitable status as part of the account creation process,
and also at a later stage by updating your subscription (but we don’t provide
the discount retroactively).</p>
<p>You will be asked to provide charity registration details (if you represent
a charity), or (if you're an individual) enough about you and your project to
show us you meet the conditions above: you agree to provide true and complete
information, and inform us if your circumstances change.</p>
</section>

<section id="accounts">
<h2>Accounts</h2>
<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup
process. This email address will be used if we need to contact you about
anything relating to your account or usage - please ensure you keep your
contact information up to date.</p>
<p>You’re responsible for all activity that takes place under your account, so
you must keep your password secure. We cannot and will not be liable for
any loss or damage from your failure to maintain the security of your account
and password. You should immediately notify us if you become aware of any
unauthorised use of your account.</p>
</section>

<section id="termination">
<h2>Termination, cancellation and suspension</h2>
<p>You can terminate this agreement at any time and for any reason by ceasing
use of the API and cancelling any subscription you have. You may also choose to
ask us to close your account.</p>
<p>We may suspend your access to the API if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have failed to make any payment due;
<li>We reasonably believe you to be in material breach of any term of
this agreement;
<li>We reasonably believe that it is necessary to do so in order to
comply with any applicable law or the order of a court or other competent
authority.
</ul>
<p>We also reserve the right to modify or terminate the API for any reason,
without notice at any time.</p>
</section>

<section id="payment">
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>Our pricing is posted at <a href="/api/">/api/</a> and is subject to change upon 30
days notice from us.</p>
<p>Your plan is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. You
must at all times ensure we are provided with valid credit or debit card
information and authorise us to deduct the monthly charges against that
card.</p>
<p>If we’re unable to process your payment we’ll try to contact you by email.
We reserve the right to limit or suspend your account until we can take
payment.</p>

<section id="copyright">

<h2>Copyright</h2>

<p>Nothing in these Terms is intended to transfer the ownership of any
intellectual property from one party to the other.</p>

<p>The API contains
Parliamentary information licensed under the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/copyright/">Open Parliament Licence</a>;

</p>

<p>The data is generated from outside sources and so we cannot, and do not,
warrant that it is accurate. We accept no liability for any errors. For the
same reason, while we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that all data
that is made available will continue to be available in the future, we cannot,
and do not, agree to keep the data up to date. We may, in our absolute
discretion, add new data sources, data fields or other forms of information
from time to time but we are under no obligation to do so.</p>

<section id="licensing">
<h2>Licensing</h2>
<p>We believe that the data may be used in accordance with these
licences given by third parties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Parliamentary material may be reused under the terms of the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/copyright/">Open Parliament Licence</a>;
<li>Our own data – lists of MPs, Lords, constituencies and so on – is available under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license version 2.5</a>;
<li>Great Britain postcode and boundary data may be used under the terms of the

<li>Northern Ireland postcode data may be used under the terms of the
    <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences">Northern Ireland End User Licence</a>.
</ul>

<p>but we cannot know whether those licences were validly given, and in
consequence, give no warranty as to the ownership of the data or the use to
which it may be put.</p>

<p>You must comply with the licence or licences relevant to the data you use,
and you are responsible for satisfying yourself that any use for which you
employ the data is lawful and does not infringe anyone’s intellectual property
rights.</p>

<h2>Attribution</h2>
<p>Please attribute us by linking to TheyWorkForYou with wording such as “Data
service provided by TheyWorkForYou” on the page where the data is used. You
must also give any appropriate attributions required by the data licences.</p>

<section id="support">
<h2>SLA and support</h2>
<p>We offer no guarantee as to the availability of the Service, and will not
be liable if it is unavailable for any reason.</p>

<section id="small-print">
<h2>Small print</h2>
<p>These Terms are subject to the law of England and Wales. They constitute all
the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and us and supersede
any prior agreements, whether written or oral.</p>
<p>You expressly understand and agree that to the maximum extent permitted by
law we exclude all liability and responsibility to you for any loss or
damage resulting, directly or indirectly, from your use of or inability to use
the API. In any event, our total liability for all claims made about the API in any
month will be no more than what you paid us for the Service the month before.</p>
<p>We shall not be deemed to have waived our right to enforce any of our
rights under this agreement merely because we have previously failed to enforce
our rights under this agreement, or permitted you to breach any term of this
agreement on one or more occasions.</p>
<p>If a court, or other competent authority, finds that any term of this
agreement is illegal or otherwise unenforceable, that term is to be treated as
if it had been severed from this agreement. Its severance will be treated (as
far as possible) as having no effect on the remainder of this agreement.</p>
