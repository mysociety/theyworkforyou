            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>TheyWorkForYou is run by the charity <a href="https://www.mysociety.org">mySociety</a>.</p>
            <p>Working in the fields of transparency and accountability,
            mySociety thinks hard and cares very much about the privacy and
            security of our users: the length of this privacy policy is one
            demonstration of that. We’ve tried, though, to keep it a clear and
            reasonably quick read.</p>
            <p>We hope it covers everything you need to know, but if you still
            have any questions please feel free to <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/contact/">contact us.</a></p>

            <p>Our basic privacy policy is very simple:</p>

            <ol>
            <li>We guarantee we will not sell or distribute any personal
            information you share with us.</li>
            <li>We will not send you unsolicited email.</li>
            <li>We will gladly show you the personal data we store about you in
            order to run the website.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>If you’d like to know more, read on.</p>

            <h3 id="information">What information we collect and how we use it</h3>

            <p id="alerts"><strong>If you sign up to receive
            <a href="/alert/">alert emails</a></strong>, we collect your email
            address along with the name of the MP, postcode, or the keywords to
            which you subscribe.</p>
            <p>We’ll send you an email every time your chosen keyword/s are
            spoken in a parliament or assembly we cover, or every time your
            chosen MP speaks. At most (depending on how common your keyword is,
            and how often your MP speaks), these will come at a frequency of one
            a day and only while a parliament or assembly we cover is in session.</p>
            <p>We may analyse alert sign-up data in aggregate, to understand
            volumes and trends in what interests citizens in parliamentary
            proceedings. If so, the data is anonymised, ie, stripped of all
            information which would identify a specific user. Our Research Data
            Release policy may be seen on request.</p>

            <p id="registration"><strong>If you register with the site</strong>,
            we collect your full name and email address, and — if you opt to
            provide them — your postcode and the URL of your website.</p>
            <p>We do not use this data for any purpose other than to allow you
            to log in to the site.</p>

            <p id="api"><strong>If you register as a paying customer for the API</strong>,
            your name, contact details, payment and security details are held
            by the payment processor Stripe, whose usage terms and privacy
            policy can be seen here: <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy">stripe.com/gb/privacy</a>.
            Your name, email address, the billing address of your card and the
            last few digits of your card or bank account number are made
            available to us along with your purchase history. We use these to
            issue invoices and send you important information about changes or
            updates to the service.</p>

            <p id="emails"><strong>If you contact us by email</strong>, your
            message will be accessible to our small team of support staff. We
            adhere to strict internal privacy policies which may be viewed on
            request.</p>
            <p>Your personal information is never shared, or used for purposes
            other than the above.</p>

            <h3 id="unsubscribe-alerts">How to unsubscribe from TheyWorkForYou
            email alerts</h3>

            <p>There is a link at the foot of every email we send you. Please
            follow this link to pause or cancel your alerts. No log-in is
            required.</p>

            <p>If you have problems unsubscribing, you can contact us on
            <a href="mailto:support@theyworkforyou.com">support@theyworkforyou.com</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="terminate">How to terminate your TheyWorkForYou account</h3>
            <p>Please contact us on <a href="mailto:support@theyworkforyou.com">support@theyworkforyou.com</a>.</p>

            <h3>Retention periods</h3>
            <p>In all cases listed above, with the exception of paying API
            customers, we retain your personal data until such a time as you
            unsubscribe, ask us to remove your details, or terminate your account.</p>
            <p>We are obliged to keep records relating to financial transactions
            for at least six years following the end of the accounting period in
            which the transaction took place. We destroy our records after this point.</p>
            <p>If you contact TheyWorkForYou via our support email address we
            reserve the right to keep your support message for up to two years.
            This is to aid continuity and so that we can view any historic
            context which may have bearing on subsequent support mail, even if
            members of the support staff change. Support staff adhere to internal
            privacy policies which may be viewed on request.</p>

            <h3 id="survey">Survey questions</h3>
            <p>In order to improve the site, we occasionally run surveys to help
            us understand who uses the site and what they want. The answers are
            completely anonymous, so we don’t collect any personal information.
            The data may be used to inform our research.</p>

            <h3 id="law">Legal basis for processing</h3>
            <p>When you use any of the functions listed above (email alerts,
            site registration or newsletters), our legal basis for processing
            your personal data is legitimate interests, described in section
            6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation. We believe we
            have a legitimate interest in providing you with email alerts on
            issues you care about being mentioned in Parliament. We believe
            there is a wider societal benefit too in this greater understanding
            and scrutiny of the actions of elected representatives.</p>
            <p>For API users, our legal basis for processing information is in
            the fulfillment of a contract.</p>

            <h3 id="access">Your right to access</h3>
            <p>You may contact us at any time to ask to see what personal data
            we hold about you. Please contact us to request this.</p>

            <h3 id="objection">Your right to object</h3>
            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation gives you the right to
            object to our processing of your personal information and to ask us
            to stop processing it. However, it also gives us the right to continue
            to process it if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for
            the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms. To
            exercise your right to object, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/contact/">you can contact us</a>,
            giving specific reasons why you are objecting to the processing of
            your personal data. These reasons should be based upon your
            particular situation.</p>

            <h3 id="complaints">What to do if you think we’ve mishandled your data</h3>
            <p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information
            Commissioner’s Office. <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/handling/">You can report a concern here</a>
            (but do contact us first, so that we can try and help).</p>

            <h3 id="cookies">Cookie policy</h3>
            <p>We use cookies to save you from having to repeatedly sign in to
            the site, and also to remember your postcode. We may also use them
            to record if you've answered one of the survey questions we ask. The
            site will work with cookies disabled, but it won't be as good.</p>

            <h3 id="analytics">Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h3>
            <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about
            how you use this site. We do this to help make sure the site is
            meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements.</p>

            <p>Google Analytics stores information such as what pages you visit,
            how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on,
            and information about your web browser. IP addresses are masked
            (only a portion is stored) and personal information is only reported
            in aggregate. We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics
            data for any purpose besides providing us with analytics information,
            and we recommend that any user of Google Analytics does the same.</p>

            <h3 id="analytics-opt-out">Opting out of Google Analytics tracking</h3>
            <p>You can <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">opt
            out of Google Analytics tracking</a>.</p>

            <p>If you want to disable advertising-based tracking, you can
            <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">adjust your Google Ads
            Settings</a>, or opt out of advertising-based tracking across a
            number of providers in one go using the
            <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network
            Advertising Initiative&rsquo;s opt-out form</a>.</p>

            <p>Rest assured, we only track usage data for one reason: to help us
            understand how we can make the site work better for you, our
            users.</p>
