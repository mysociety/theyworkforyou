The <strong>Senedd</strong>, officially known as the Welsh
Parliament in English and Senedd Cymru in Welsh, is the devolved,
unicameral legislature of Wales. A democratically elected body, it
makes laws for Wales, agrees certain taxes and scrutinises the Welsh
Government. It is a bilingual institution, with both Welsh and
English being the official languages of its business. From its
creation in May 1999 until May 2020, the Senedd was known as the
National Assembly for Wales (Welsh: Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru).
