                    Opened in December 1999, Westminster Hall is aimed at
                    fostering a new style of debate. Sessions are open to all
                    MPs, who sit in a horseshoe arrangement which is meant to
                    encourage constructive rather than confrontational debate.

                    The meetings are presided over by a Deputy Speaker and
                    there are no votes.
