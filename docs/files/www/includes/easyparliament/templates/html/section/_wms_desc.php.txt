                Written Ministerial Statements were introducted in late 2002 to
                stop the practice of having &ldquo;planted&rdquo; or &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; questions
                designed to elicit Government statements.

                They are just that &ndash; statements on a particular topic by a Government Minister.
