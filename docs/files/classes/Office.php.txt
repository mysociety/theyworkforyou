     * selctee0001_2004-06-08.html). So if the date is those dates for those two
     * things, you don't want to display it because it's not a known start date,
     * it could have been before that date. 2005-11-10 is because the PPS changes
     * did not all happen on that date but the website did not update until that
     * date so it outputs "before" in either from/to date in that case.
     * 2009-01-16 is the last date before the page disappeared off parliament.uk
     * entirely so that displays that fact that after then we don't know.
